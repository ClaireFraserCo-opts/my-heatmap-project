  "text": "This must seem confusing and od, um, and so on. But I felt when you left, I felt really sorry that the interview had been kind of cut short. Because I sort of felt maybe there were other things you wanted to say. I don't know. I'm being moved, though, right? I'm trying transferred. And, uh. I was just wondering if I'm quite ready for a transfer. I've mentioned that it's annoying that woman talks or been yelling like that, but I really rather like that word. And, uh, I have been helping. I had a thought maybe I could go home from there. I know being transferred means I've probably been put to work in the laundry all day. And I don't feel quite up to that. So if that's one immediate thing of concern. Am I ready to face whatever's involved in moving away from a spot where I've. You get kind of oriented to one. Place when you get sort of used to it. I meant to correct one thing. When I said no before, I didn't mean I was tired of talking to that doctor. I just meant no that I was ready to that I wonder why I couldn't go home. Yeah. He didn't quite understand you on that, really. He thought I was being blunt, and I just meant no, I didn't want to talk to him anymore. And if I sense some of your feeling now, it is, um. A little tenseness that, uh. Maybe he didn't really get that. Maybe he thought you were sort of shutting him off or something. That's what I had thought. That isn't what I meant. Ah. I don't know. I'm wondering if the, uh, transfer is a good thing. I mean, they make you feel so important around here, and still you aren't. But then when I go over to two, I know that's an open ward, that's dormitory. And I've been wearing not so many my own clothes because I don't like to laundry them. Just. What I'm quite ready for that change. Um, my father and that don't come to visit me or anything. So I don't get out at all on weekends or anything. And I'm not quite clear about this. Is it in the word where you are now that you feel they seem to make you so important, but then really you're not? Is that. That's really important? But I'm really not. I probably wouldn't be on the other word. Well, I know that you're not very important when you move to that word. I see. So that if you're not, uh, very important where you are right now, you feel. And if you were transferred, even less important. So if that's something that concerns you. I think it means working all day in the laundry, too. And I'm not quite ready for that. I mentioned earlier that I had this tickling sensation in my knees when I was on 6th feet. When I was getting reciprocal. Franco, I think it was. And I asked the doctor at that time if he would move me so I could go to work and work in the laundry. And the transfer came today. I didn't ask to be transferred all this time. But it troubles you as to whether you're really ready to face some of the things that would be involved. I don't know. There isn't much to face. It's kind of confusing, I think. I see. It's more a question of facing the uncertainty. What you mean? I don't know what I mean. Right now. You feel kind of mixed up. Well, I know there's Anita, that ward that I didn't trust very far. Because she's the one that put me on shock treatment. I see. Or I think she did anyway. And still she put her arm around my shoulder when I came back. But she was one that told me I had to go on. And I had done nothing that I knew of to be put on that kind of treatment. So there's something that's real confusing. It'll be putting you next to a person who seemed to like you and put a arm around you. And. My gosh, was responsible for shock. That's right. Of course, she said it was doctor's orders. But I hadn't talked to a doctor that I knew of at the time. And I know that they gave him to. Even though that was a work ward. They had them go over to the treatment ward and then back to the work ward, and then to work. Sure, here are all the explanations. It was doctor's orders and all that. But you can't help but feel, is she really trustworthy? Because here she. I don't trust people anyway anymore. That's why I don't want them to trust me. I either believe in them or I don't believe them. And it's all or none. And I don't quite think I believe in her very much. And really, with most people, you feel. I don't think I trust them. That's the truth. I don't trust them. Either believe them or I don't believe them. Or I don't. I'm not quite certain whether I believe them yet. Or not. But I don't believe in trust anymore. That's one thing that you feel has really dropped out for you, that just to trust people, not for you. No, I don't trust them. You can get hurt much too easily by trusting people. If you really believe in someone and let your trust go out to them. Then I don't have any trust. That's why I can't let any trust go out to them. But evidently your feeling is that when that has happened in the past, that's the way you can get hurt. The way I have been hurt. The way you have been hurt. I don't mind being moved. I mean, it's another thing toward going home, but I don't get out anyway. And I don't know that he's my brother. I wrote a letter, but I didn't get any answer. He never came. At least what I understand you to be saying is it isn't this practical question of the move so much? Uh, but it's the question of I'm. Quite ready for that. Yeah. Are you ready for a next step? I don't think I will like working in the laundry, that I know, because I didn't like it either the other times. And I don't think I care too much working in the food center over there either, because I've worked there before and I didn't care for it. Well, I didn't have anything. The first day I worked all right. The second day, I worked about half an hour and I blacked out. And I tried it three more days and I blacked out each day. So I just quit trying to work it out. There was too much electricity or something. Feel something was wrong over there. Too much electricity or something. It really had a bad effect on me when I was working. It did. I blacked, um, out completely. If I had gone sat down, I. Would have painted feel really. You were in kind of a desperate way at those points. No, I didn't feel desperate. I didn't understand that. I didn't know why I blacked out. It didn't frighten me, though. Just something very od happening to you. More because I don't have epilepsy seizures or anything like that, so I couldn't imagine what it was. I don't usually have painting spells. It's made you feel real puzzled. What is happening to me? What it was? Yeah, I tried, but I couldn't work, and they wanted me to work. So sometimes I think you put back on treatment if you refuse to work. Maybe shock treatment is really something they may use for punishment if you don't do the things they want you to do. Well, it would appear that way from everybody. Everybody says, but I don't know why they even gave it to me in the first place. I was just beginning to come to enough to realize that I was in an institution, I think. And the next thing I knew, they said, you're ready. You're on treatment. And I said, why? I didn't do anything. I haven't had any fight or anything with anybody. They said, well, doctor's orders. And I said, well, I haven't even talked to a doctor because I hadn't talked to one. At least I didn't know it if I had. So to you, it seemed here I was just beginning to come to life a little. They really didn't know a little bit what was going on. I was just beginning to realize I was in the hospital when they put me on it. And they put me to work the same day. Then you feel that for no reason you could discern things over you. And I began talking very badly and everything. And I still have forgotten some of the things I said. It feels that as though that sort of brought out the worst in you. Is that what you mean? If I had a worst part, it was like it wasn't even me talking. Uh, almost seemed as though. Then I went home weekends, and I got in trouble there because I talked so much. Of course, I was getting sodium amethystol, too. So it might have been a combination of the two. Not just the one thing. But there, too. I guess I get the feeling that you're wishing you could understand that part of yourself. Was this something that was not you talking, or was it just the effect of the drugs or what was it that made you? Combination. I think, as you notice, I moved my feet. As I said, my knees tip. I don't know if the drugs I'm getting or what, but I something I can't help. It isn't that I'm so terribly nervous that I can't sit still. I do that at group meetings or anything, and I can't control them. It's rather embarrassing. And you would like me to understand that it isn't just tenseness or something. It's simply something I can't control. Uncontrollable tickling sensation in my knees and therefore. And my feet just move. If I'm sitting up there in the corner alone, that isn't so much. But my knees still tickle. But when I get in a group and that my body just move. Seems as though being in a group makes this worse. I have it when I'm alone sometimes too. I think it's medication I'm getting. Probably it's just the drugs. I think it's the gray medication I'm getting. I don't even know what it is because I have quite one. I think these meetings are very enlightening. Well, if you can't think quite clear at the time, you can think about it later on. In that sense, they're somewhat helpful in. I think I've been helping more by talking than I have by the pills. Really. It seems as though getting things out to some degree and talk seems to. Alleviate whatever the situation is. If it's created situation that seems to alleviate. Wish that woman would quit screaming. Why doesn't she stop? She can't stop though. That force doesn't. That gives you a terrible feeling. What's going to happen to you if you end up like that? Part of the disturbance of that noise is the feeling, my God, um. Could this happen to me? Yes, exactly. You think you could just go out of your head just from hearing that all the time? That's been going on for three days now. And why did they give her that much if it's who I think it is? She was up on the word for one of those gyn clinics and I sat next to her and she said something about liking to talk. And all of a sudden she just began talking and didn't quit. This seems kind of awful that here was this person. She was all perfectly all right then calm next to you and gone. And now here it's just going on and on. I should think. I thought they could relieve, let that make them worse. Kind of discouraging in a sense to feel that they seems to you that they aren't helping her. Yes, considering it's an admission ward and they shouldn't be that far out of their heads. It's more like the drugs they're giving after the year are doing it to them. Almost makes you feel. Are they making her worse with their drugs? That's right. That's kind of a disturbing. I think it is thought too. Because after all, I'm doing drugs too. And I wouldn't want to end up like that. I can't help but raise the question in you. Would the drugs they're giving me make me like that? That's right. Then once you're that way, what can you do about it? Only I know what they're like and I can see it. So I have enough control to hang on to myself, enough to keep from just batting my head against the wall. Like some of them have that feeling and they just can't control it. I've seen so much of it and heard so much of it that I can hang on to myself a little bit. Those things are kind of. I think that's why my. Pardon me. I think that's why my knees tingle, though, because rather than batting my head against the wall, I have that type of reaction. In a sense, you can hold yourself enough so that you're going to bat your head against the wall. Head is as though it has to come out somewhere and it comes out. In the tickling of your knees because, um. Well, I've seen them on the outside, too, so, I mean, I know that it's just futile to bat your head. Why? Anyway, I think my head is valuable to bat against the wall, my own head, and I like it. My gosh, I'm not going to smash my head against walls. That's right. After. Ah. All Scott gave me that head. That's the head I want. I'm not going to bang it against the wall even if I like to, which I really wouldn't like to do anyway. Well, how does that help that girl to being locked up like that and screaming like that? What beneficial aid is she getting out of that? I guess that's the question you're asking yourself. What earthly good. No, I'm asking you. You're asking me. Well, I'm not on the hospital staff and I really guess I wouldn't try to answer because I don't know her and don't know anything about it. But what I can understand is the way that that affects you and the feelings that it stirs up in you. It sounds as though with you that is disturbing not only from the noise from her, but the things that it stirs up in you. I don't know. I'm all mixed up. I want to go to building one, but still, I know building one is not next to home tenants, but if I could go home to one, I'd be asking. I've been there before. I know it's going to be a great change from this building. I hate to do this building because it's quite beautiful, but still, maybe it's better looking for that girl screaming all day, every day. It's a real tough choice to make. But I hate to think that I'm going to have to go to work from the laundry and there isn't as much to do around that ward. As there is here. That much I know. To feel. If they let you relax and sleep because you do have this. But I don't think they do think they expect you to work if you can. They don't go that far. They just let you rest like you were in a hospital for a rest, keep you working all the time. If it represented a chance to rest, then you might like it. But if it's a chance just to work all the time, uh, then you're. Not sure that I don't think I'm ready for it. Because my niece, pickle maybe that I worked in the laundry before and I know I got along all right. I know I can get along now. But I could do it. But am I really why? I packed my own grip, so I'm all ready to go. I didn't say no, I won't go because I'm always putting up a big fight about it. That's an improvement while I'm willing to go along with it. Chance you're willing to take, although within yourself you feel a lot of question about it. I rather like seeing them admitted, although I can't say that I like to see them get worse. But when they improve, it's quite a joy to see where they're all coming in and going out. It kind of helps you inside when. They know that others get well. So that you're sort of discouraged and incurred. I had thought that I'd go home from here because I hadn't done anything very serious or I hadn't, uh, had any violent struggle with anybody or anybody, anything like that. That's part of your feeling all the way through. I haven't done anything wrong. I've held myself in. I really have not been violent. I haven't broken many rules. I haven't broken any. I don't think broken any. And half the time you have to find out what the rules are because. They don't tell you what your feeling is. I've been good. I haven't been too good, though, because you can go overboard about being good too. I don't believe in that either. I've been as good as I know how to be and I'm not letter perfect. I would like to be, but I'm not. But in terms of what you can do, you feel you've done the best you can do. As good as I know how, Loretta. I know that some of these people have got to go and I expect we've got to call it quits. I appreciate this chance to talk with you. Thank you very much. I know that you're very important people. Thank you. Thank you. I was wondering, Dr. She asked several times, but we assure us about.",

He thinks it might be the effect of the drugs or the combination of the two.\n- Speaker B wants to bat his head against the wall because he likes seeing others get worse.
