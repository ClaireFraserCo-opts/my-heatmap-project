It. And I want to tell you a little bit of why I wanted to talk with you tonight. I'm interested in the people who come to this hospital, and I'm also interested in trying to learn how we can be of more help to them in the future. You. That's why you're all hooked up and I'm all hooked up. Now, um, what I would like would be for you to tell me anything you're willing to tell me about yourself and your situation, how you feel about yourself, your situation, or I guess another way of putting it is that, um, anything you were willing to tell me that would help me to know you better, I'd be very glad to hear. When do you want me to start? Wherever you would like to. Well, start with my childhood. When I was a little girl, I had this cross eye since I was about seven years old. And, I mean, kids poked fun of me. And as the ears got longer and I start going into the higher grades, I never had no boyfriends or anything. I mean, I had girlfriends, but after the girls started growing with the boys, um, and the boys would tell them, don't go wrong with me, or something like that. And then, actually, then I ended up without any girlfriends at all. And around our neighborhood, there was no girls my age. So I was pounding on the school friends and they sort of let me down. And I felt just like it wasn't wanted. Sort of wound up with no friends at all. And am I getting it right? Did you feel that was, uh, due basically to your eye condition? Well, probably the looks. Probably my looks, too. But, uh, in those days you had the kind of glasses that couldn't cover up a cross eye. But, uh, in my last year of school, I made a friend with this one girl, but, uh, she wasn't a very nice girl. But, I mean, when she was with me, she was nice. I mean, if we went out with some guys or anything, they started getting funny. I'd get out of the car and then she'd follow me because she didn't want to be there alone. But in my husband, he didn't want me to go around with her because he didn't like her. And like most of my friends that I did have from when I was a childhood when I lived on the east side, kids from around the house. But that's when I was really young. And they grew up and they all moved away. I can't even see them. He won't let me see him or anything. Do you feel here's this one girl whom you like, even if she doesn't have a very good reputation, and your friends from way back, but that your husband won't let you associate with them. I mean, like, um, my friends once, well, that like, to go out with guys and all that, he don't care for those. And then my other girlfriends that are nice, he don't care for those because he don't like their husbands or something like that. So then he don't want me going with him. I mean, a woman has to get out once in a while. I mean, to jibber jabber a little bit like myself, I got to stay in a house all day long. And with him not wanting me to go with my friends, then he don't want me to go alone anyplace. Actually, he's the one that would take me out. I would go out with him. But then if we went dancing or any place like that, he danced with other girls, and he wouldn't even dance with me. So then I dance with other guys too, if that two can play the game. If he's not really going to pay much attention to you, then, okay, you can do that too. It's good for the gander. It's good for the goose. So I would say. And then my home situation now is. Well, that's part of it. My husband won't let me go anyplace. But then there's my mother too. My husband's brother's staying downstairs there. And mother, I don't like the idea of it. I mean, my mother isn't married to him, and yet he acts like he's a father to my two brothers. And we're living upstairs in my mother's place. And even though I marry, he tries to boss me around. So that's another thing you don't like. You don't quite like the situation your mother is in, and you don't like him because he acts like he's married to her. Yes. And, I mean, he don't work where the heck. I mean, he works a couple of months out of a year, and my mother's only getting Social Security, and she just can't. I know she can't afford it, but yet she still wants him to stay. She feels she wants him to stay. But you certainly don't like that arrangement. Is that, um, she's only living on $20 a month for food already. And with having to have him stay there and eat and my God, they probably eat beans all the time. It wouldn't be that bad if he wasn't there got to be buying cigarettes and all that stuff? Could be saving that money for food. Actually, with the little money she gets, he's actually living off her. Sounds like you feel pretty resentful of that. Yes. Well, I don't care for it. See, everybody's up against it. My mother's mother. I'm sorry. I didn't get that. My mother's mother, uh, don't like it either. Well, she don't like to have her daughter talked about by my mother's brothers and sisters. So I guess you're saying I'm not the only one that feels that way about her and her situation. Yes. I mean, I'm not the only one. But if anybody tells her anything, she's so boheaded and not headed that if somebody tells her to do something or to get away from her or something, she'll just stay with them. I mean, she wants to do things her own self. But even though I'm married, she wants to try to ruin my life. I hate the idea of everybody telling me what to do. Even my husband tell me what to do. Even though I'm young and I'm married, I'm a human being. I like to run m my life myself. I mean, m I don't want to feel like I'm still in a baby buggy or something like that. You feel it's your mother and your husband, and everybody tries to run your life. Yes. That's why I feel I was old enough to bear a baby. And that's surely a lot of pain. But yet they won't let me make up my mind for myself. Here I was, old enough to have a child, and yet nobody thinks I can make my decisions or, uh, run my own life. Is that what you're saying? Yes. Now, this is when my husband and I went to California with my little boy. I mean, we were more happier out there. He didn't have to run home to his mother all the time. And his mother is another one that we just don't get along. She hated me right from the day she saw me. But when we went to California, we had a good time out there. I guess you're saying that kind of shows that when we're just by ourselves, we really get along better. Yes, we can get along better. I mean, we can go to shows and all that and dancing and we have a good time. But then being back in a whole situation, it's just not because his mother is a person that talked behind her own brother's back. I mean, her own son. My husband has six brothers, one sister. And, I mean, she'll talk to one of her sons about one of her other sons. She's that kind of person. And although she don't come right out and tell me to my face that she don't like me, I know by the way she's talking about the other people behind her backs that she's talking about me too. You feel she's just a gossip, and you feel she doesn't like you. Well, I know she don't like me. No doubt about that. No doubt. But mostly that's the point. My little girl, she passed away a couple of months ago in November. And my mother did another thing. M see, when my little girl was born, I asked my mother, I said, um, how come her leg, her one leg is, um, turned a little bit? And she said, well, um, all babies are like that when they're small. She says, you can't expect them to get up and walk right away. And I said, I know that. She said, don't worry about it. So I didn't worry about it. And then after my little girl passed away, my mother told me that my daughter was crippled. She kept it from me again. She keeps things from me like that. And in a way, then I felt responsible for my little girl's death. She would be sitting down, um, uh, I'd sit her up in a davenport in the corner. I'd put her little legs in. But if I would have known she was crippled, I surely wouldn't have did that. That really concerns you that that was kept from you. And it concerns you that maybe you didn't deal with her right, not knowing that she was crippled. Yes, I know I still knew her, that her little foot was sort of like that. But I didn't know how long it was. I mean, I didn't know when my mother said that when he was born, but I didn't know actually, when she was going to outgrow. That sounds like you're saying. I kind of trusted my mother on this. And then, by golly, she wasn't to be trusted. But my mother, I always took the blame home. My mother always liked my oldest brother. I always took the blame home, whether I did something wrong or not. And I got along a lot better with my father. But then my father passed away. Well, actually, I took all the blaming. Might as well, uh, say that my brother did. And now my youngest brother, that's home, he's going through the same darn thing I am. He's taking all the blame now, do. You feel when you were home, that whatever went wrong, um, you took the blame for it within yourself? No. My brother would say that I did this and that. I see. That's what I wasn't quite sure about. You were blamed for everything, whether you had done it or not. It isn't so much that you felt you were to blame, but others blamed you. I mean, my brother actually got away with everything. I guess you feel that that was sort of true with everybody except with your father. Is that things went somewhat better between you and your father. Yes, they did. I mean, I could go and he'd take me. Well, my mother and father, they used to go out a lot of times, but they went sort of late because then by that time, I'd be asleep. I used to fool them a lot of times because I knew they were going to stop in the hamburger shop. I'd make beat. I was sleeping. And then when they'd stopped and I'd say, oh, I'm awake. I'm awake. You got to get me one too. I used to have a lot of fun when I used to go out with my mother and father. And mostly when I went away with my father, I used to help him pile wood. We had a lot of fun. The neighborhood kids would come over, boys and girls, and they helped my father pile up the wood and help him cut it with a saw. And then after that, we all piled it in the car, went down, got ice cream cone. Those are kind of pleasant memories. You. It sort of looks as though thinking about those things makes you feel a little bit weepy. Or am I wrong? Okay, a little bit. I can remember. I don't exactly know how it went, but I knew I was pretty young. But we went over by my father's relation anyway. His brother. Yes, it's his brother we went over by. And then it was I and David, my brother, my oldest brother. Anyhow, the two guys decided to go out. And then my mother and my aunt and I, my brother were there and her children and. Yeah, I don't know if I'm getting this quite clearly, but it's hard to remember. Um. But anyhow, my father didn't come back to real late. My mother was mad at him, and I don't know. Before I knew it, I was going with my father in his car. And it was stormy night. It scared the wits out of me. But my mother somehow got home ahead of us. My uncle took her home. But on that stormy night, it seemed like. I don't know, it seems so spooky out. Just like I was scared we were going to get in a crash or something because daddy was drinking a little bit. And while he was driving, he had his arm around me. I was standing up on the seat. I don't even know how old I was. I mean, I just. That's something that's so far back, it's kind of vague. And yet certain parts of it evidently are very vivid to you. You can remember his being not coming back and you can remember your mother being angry. But mostly you can remember this spooky, wild ride with him through the storm and your fear that you might crash up and he's holding you with his arm around you. Yes. And even after a while, when we would go out for a ride, if it would be at nighttime, I'd be scared to ride. I would be afraid I was going over a cliff or something. I always thought we were going to come to, uh, dead end and we'd go flying over the cliff. Am I getting this right? But even after that, it just seemed to you as though you and your father were headed for a Cliff. Yes. I mean, everybody was with us. But I sort of shut my eyes when I was driving because I was scared to look out the window. Because I think we're going over a cliff, or I'd be thinking that we're going to be coming to one and daddy's not going to be able to stop us. Something just felt he isn't going to be able to manage it. He's going to go over the edge. That's funny, I never said these things before to the other doctors. It I can remember too, when I was small. My cousin, she's a year younger than I am. And I don't know, it seemed like I was always pushed out of the way. She was always better than me. And. I don't know, I always try to improve myself by doing hard work and making good credits and good drawings. Even now, even though I'm married, I never had really lot of boyfriends or anything through my school. But even though now I'm married, m I want to look attractive in another guy's eyes. Even though I'm married, I didn't have that before. And by being married so young, it seems like I'm missing it. So that somehow, just as you wanted to do things right when you were and get proper credits and so on when you were young, now you feel as though I'd like to be attractive to other men, even though I am married. Sort of as though you feel I missed out on something. And then if I could talk to a guy and all this and that and kiss. But really, all guys will take advantage of a girl. Every guy will try it. But if he ever did try it on me, I couldn't feel I had the power to even scratch him. I couldn't hurt anybody. I mean, I can't even hurt if I would get in an argument with a girl or something like that, and she could be ready just to cut my throat, and I couldn't lay a finger on her. I can't really protect myself against either fellows or girls because I just can't hurt somebody. I feel like if I hurt them m if I got in a fight with them and I really hurt them, that they would die. Then maybe they'd send me to prison or maybe I would die or something. That's what always comes across my mind. I just can't. Or even, like my husband, he could kill me or anything, and I wouldn't even touch him. I just feel like I was just paralyzed. Feel I can't strike back because there's a feeling that if I should protect myself, defend myself, strike back, then that would kill the other person, and then I'd be punished. Well, then sometimes too, it's different times. If it's somebody I don't like, that's when I'm afraid that I might really kill more, hurt him bad, like my husband. I don't know. Maybe. I saw a show one time long ago that probably made me feel like if it could be a show, like this person probably was trying to kill I'll say, like, this one person was probably trying to kill me. And pretty soon, uh, I give him a bat or something like that, and probably I killed him m instead. And then that way I would be sending. I don't think of it. You don't really think of it, but. Somehow that's the way it feels to you that if you ever struck back when someone struck at you, that would kill them. But when I was younger, I don't even remember when I started feeling like that. I know one time that I took this one boy, we were fighting, and I took him and I bit him in the finger. So the blood just came coming. I mean, it was just coming out real fast. And then his mother came out, and I don't know, she hollered, and then she said, if you want a crust of bread to chew on, she said, why don't you run home and get it? Or she'd throw me a crust of bread because we got in a fight. But actually this boy, he bit me, so I bit him back. But I didn't mean to bite him in the bone. I didn't mean to hurt him. But at least you feel. See, when I was young, I didn't have this fear. When he bit me, I bit him back. Even bit him harder than I meant to. I even feel that way towards animals. If somebody would hurt an animal, I'd be right there to pick it up. If it was a little bird, if it was a mouse. I'm actually scared of a mouse when it's running, but I mean, when it's hurt, I'm not. When something's hurt, I'm right there ready to take care of it. But I can't see what made me go into that scared feeling. I don't know when it started. How did I get that fear that if I strike out, it really would be fatal for the other person? I don't know. I don't know when it started. Probably in another way, too. I feel like maybe I want friends. Friends so bad that I don't want to hurt them because I don't want to lose them. Maybe that's the way I feel. That's a possible thing, that maybe it is that I feel so much unwanted by people and I want friends so much that I just couldn't take the risk of hurting anybody because I might be driving away a friend. On the eyes. I didn't hear. I said, those little holes up there are hard on the eyes. Supposed to make you tired. Is it making you tired or more relaxed? Are you saying that because it feels as though it makes you tired? No. I mean, I feel so relaxed. Though. Somehow you let down a little. No, just because I said it. Now my heart's pouring again. I mean, a lot of times, too, I'm always afraid I might talk to somebody and I'm not going to say the right words. I mean, I might make a friend go away because they probably think I'm stupid or something. Sometimes it's not all the times. It's just sometimes that it feels like I just want to say something. Like I think ahead of what I'm going to say and yet it comes out different. But there's always a feeling. Look out, look out. Be careful of what you say because even that may drive somebody away. Well, I don't think that it might drive somebody away, but it's probably just. A feeling isn't really as clear to you as what I said. It's more that maybe that is the. Uzi kind, the Uzi kind. Just in a vague sort of way. Maybe that's what you feel underneath or something like that. I know when I got the measles one time, I had an awful dream, and I don't know what it was. I know it felt just like something was just, I don't know, like the house was going to keep it or, I don't know, I was being smothered. Like, I always try to think of what that could have, could be, but I know I sure, when I woke up, gee, I sure felt awful. That was just an awful dream of things kind of smothering you. And you wondered what meaning that did have. I mean, in my mind, it seemed like it was some kind of a big object. It was a big thing anyway. Some big thing was really falling on you and smothering you. I mean, it really seemed like a cloud, just like it was sort of smother me. I mean, trying to pull me in the cloud or somewhere. Almost as though it seemed like the cloud was sort of swallowing you up. Something like that. It, it. Trying to remember way back. I don't know what I'm trying to reach to, though. I know a lot of times, though, I felt like running away from home, in a way. As much as I love my father, as I grew older, it seems as though when I was young, I mean, I don't know, but, well, I guess every parent has to hit their children once in a while. But it. Sounds as though perhaps this is what you're saying, that when you really think back and try to understand your childhood, then you feel, gosh, I'm not so sure about my father. He surely seemed to be harsh. Me, my father, he's been gone for years now. I mean, most of his memory isn't. I mean, I don't have too much memory of him since he passed away. It's either something I don't want to, I don't have time to think about it, because when I'm home, I got my own worries to think about. Don't you know that you don't really have many thoughts or memories of him? And whether that's because you try to, or whether it's because you put them out of mind, or whether it's just that you have too many worries of your own. Well, now I'm up here, well, down on tubi. Since I came up to the hospital, um, I've been here. Today is Tuesday. I would be here two weeks tomorrow. All the while I was in a hospital, I didn't even think about the people back home. Except I only thought of mostly my little boy. I mean, I didn't think of, um, them back home. I just wanted to make myself happy for a change. Um, I got other things to do. I don't have to be worried about when the next meal is coming in, when we're going to have somebody just be dying and waiting to go out to have a good time once in a while. I don't have to listen to all the gossip between Wesley's mother and everybody. I don't have to take the kind of treatment I do for my husband. Being away from home is the best thing. It's been a relief to be away from all that. But now that I'm downstairs and to be, I don't feel actually nervous or I hate anybody. But when I first went down there, I didn't like it because the door was locked. I thought to myself, gee, I was just thinking, what am I doing down here? I never even hurt anybody. But it's different. There's things to do. So at first, you just couldn't understand it, but now at least you feel, well, it isn't too bad. It's not too bad. Then my husband came today. My grandma came today. My grandpa came today. My mother came today, and his brother came today. They all came today. I cried when I saw my mother and grandma come in, just for a few seconds. And after a while, when I knew where they were going back, I didn't even miss them already. And when m my grandpa came in, I don't know, all of a sudden, I had the nerve to talk. I mean, I had the nerve to say what I've been wanting to say to him. I told him, I said, trump, what's a whole shooting after you? I said, I'd say, take yourself, grandpa, for instance. I said, you and grandma, you want to think of me as your little granddaughter? I used to run to the store for you and how you used to pity me because the other ones, like my cousin, more than me. And I told my husband, and I said, and you, I said, in the way you treat me around the house, I said, you treat me as though I wasn't wanted or I can't do anything. And I looked at my mother and I told her, and I said, you never give me no kind thought. If I couldn't get stuff right away, you'd be ready to hit me and scold me and punish me for every little thing. And, I mean, I had a nerve, and I never did before. You just feel really surprised at yourself that, by golly, you could tell them some of the things you've been thinking and feeling. And I didn't care if I hurt their feelings or not. They don't think of me as being married. They think I'm just young and they want to make my decisions for me, and they want to do this and they want to do that. And, oh, God, they think I'm just not. Just not capable and old enough to make my own decisions. But, I mean, I really had the nerve to tell them off today, and I didn't care if I hurt their feelings or not. I felt, well, if they don't like what I said, they can just go jumping away. You just feel kind of strong and pleased that you were able to tell them what you felt. They always told me what they felt. Only I was scared to tell them that before because even though they were pitting me and all that stuff, and I didn't have no friends, in a way, I felt like I wanted to be pity. But now I'm married. That was when I was 14, not so long ago, but they still want to make my decisions for me. So you feel part of the change is in you? That earlier, yes, you wanted their pity and you wanted them to feel sorry for you. But now you feel, I'm married and I'm able to make my own choices. Yes. Because when I was small one, I wanted them to feel sorry and pity me because, well, I didn't have any friends. I mean, I want to feel at least if they couldn't love me with their whole heart, at least a little pity and a little sorry for me. At least that's better. That would be better than nothing. But now I'm married, I want to bring up my family the way I want them, not the way they want me to. Like, if my husband would ask me something, and I'll be, and my mother will be in our presence, he'll ask me something before I get a chance to answer him. My mother will talk for me. I mean, I don't get a chance to talk myself. I just don't have a chance to be a person. Everybody's all ready to be me for. Me, just like everybody. One's got one leg, the other one's got one arm, and just like they all got part of me and I got none of myself. Mhm. M but yet I'll be in a war, too, down there. When we had that group discussion, um, this morning, I believe it was. A lot has happened today. Yeah. Nobody wanted to start the conversation, I felt like I wanted to. I mean, I want to feel sort of big, and I felt like I want to be the one to break it, but yet I just couldn't. It seemed like my heart was pounding. I was afraid to come out and say something. Then I was the second one that talked anyway, then we started the conversation. But I don't know, it does seem when I get in a crowd that I don't have much to say. But, uh, if I go with, for instance, um, always say, like, I would go my one girlfriend, and I could talk to her and say a whole bunch of stuff. Um, but if I would go with my one girlfriend and her girlfriend, I wouldn't have much to say because I'd feel, well, my girlfriend would rather be off with her other girlfriend, and they probably wouldn't want to talk to me or anything. That's just the way I'd feel. You always feel pretty sure that if there's any choice, they would rather prefer the other person. Yes. I've got to stop in a minute or two. I'm sorry. Um. Am I going to got to do this again? Do I have to do this again? Would you like to or not? Well, I don't know. I said things that I didn't tell the other doctors. I mean, I don't know, I just seem like I can't get relaxed when I sit up and feel m. It. Sort of helps to be lying down. Right now. I can't think of anything that's going to be different. I mean, it all seems the same to me. Most of it is what I told the other doctors, too. But I don't think there's nothing else. Well, I guess I feel as though I really had gotten to know you quite a bit. In this time, I feel you really have been able to tell me who you are. And I guess I'd just like to say that good luck to you as you try to be yourself and have your own. I'm waiting for the date. I feel like that date comes. I bet you it's going to feel like a different soul just jumped in me or something. You can be yourself. It would feel as though a new soul had come into you. Give me a stronger hope. Well, I got my hopes up high. Yet. You'Re not defeated. No, nothing's bothering me. What bothers me if something happens to bother me while I'm down in war, too, I just pick up a book and read, or I'm making a cap already. They start this afternoon, little before five and got quite a bit done. Well, I do have to go. I appreciate talking with you, and I really do hope that things go well for you. Girl will come in and just a minute. And she'll take off the harness. Bye.
