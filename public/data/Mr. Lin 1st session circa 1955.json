And when I talked to you and we arranged this appointment, I didn't even ask you one thing. So, um, I went because I was sort of hesitate to go into it. But, uh. Uh, fact remains that it's homosexuality. And I want to change. So I talked with Iri about it about a year ago last summer. And, uh. Um. We had a rather long interview. And then he decided that I'd better see someone, but not him because relationship is too close. Uh, of course, this is the first I've gotten down to business with it. Uh, I've been thinking about it ever since. And I, uh, am confused mentally. I go around in circles. I don't know where to start. And I've looked backwards. Just try and find if I could find the cause, if that would help any. Doesn't seem to. And I don't think I could find it if I wanted to. And the only thing I figured out was that the important thing is to find out where I stand now. And start from now. Rather than psychoanalytically or something back in the past I'm trying to dig up. Um. I don't know. But the thing I'm curious about is that you do want to do something about. Yes, but I don't know. Problem. But as you've tried to think it over, you sort of go around and round in circles. And heck, I'm to feel that maybe the most important thing for you is to try to figure out what's true right now. Or what's the situation right now. Is that. Yes, sort of. Yes. And m to start from where I am now rather m I see. Rather than to go back and try. And find a cause or something. And then you can't go back in the past and eradicate the cause. And try and come m up with, uh, a past solution, shall we say? Of course. That's what I'd always want. That's what I suppose everybody wants. Immediate solution or something. But I don't think it's going to be like that. What you wouldn't mind having? No. But you doubt if you'll find it. Well, I looked for it in music, and it was the same thing. I mean, I think it's sort of a carryover. I thought there was a key to, uh, how to be a good musician. There's no key, of course. You can't read it in a book. If you feel like you're in that area too. You had a tendency to think now, solution. There's something that is going to make this thing all clear up. Uh. If I find the thing I'd be a good musician. But gradually have learned just as ridiculous. And also I feel that all sorts of things are tied up I mean the one thing I found out when I went to art was that shortly after that interview which was sort of a catharsis uh. Um. I gained ten pounds in uh. Two weeks which I think. Which gave me something to think about anyway from the standpoint that probably problems I have in uh. Thinking and music and anything else is all tied up. I mean it's tied up very closely. Problems with health or something. I don't know but there's some. It. Well uh. When art said something about uh. He thought that it had crept into my music from the standpoint that uh. I was making mistakes where mistakes shouldn't be made I mean he says there's no reason for you to do these things and I do them still. He says it's form of self punishment. Well I don't know. I think the thing is in the form of uh. A neurosis I'm afraid to go ahead I've always been afraid of new things to go into something entirely new. It carries over a little bit in music. I'm sort of afraid to take up a new piece. Uh. I'm afraid when at college, well further back in that actually from high school going to college I was rather afraid to go into the new situation make all the new adjustments that had to be made. It wasn't so much coming to a school down here though. But you do feel that's kind of characteristic of you that anything new. For a long time I don't know, meeting new people. I did sort of carry some. I don't know. So you have. Well that was the idea I wanted to give was something confused, medaling. I can't think straight so I m also understand that but I'm the one that has to solve the problem and not you. And yet I sort of want uh. You to do it for me or something. It might. I guess what you're saying is that maybe it's supposed to be that you solve the problem or something but the thing you really feel is that you would hope very much that I would. Yeah that's very close to. It's amazing though, indeed. After thinking about this thing for a year and a half I've come up with nothing that remotely resembles an insight into it. I mean I just don't. As I said before it's just been going around in circles I don't have a very clear perceptive. In other words, I guess you're sitting there. I've wrestled and wrestled with this thing. And I don't see a bit more about it and don't understand it a bit better than I did at the outset. Yeah, that's exactly it. I just don't know how one goes about changing that sort of thing. It's just a mystery to you as to how a person would make a start changing himself or in understanding himself. Yeah, well, uh. I go on dates all the time. Not all the time, but occasionally because I can be attracted to women. And yet, uh. I don't know, that just doesn't seem to be the real thing. I mean, there's no real attraction. Um. Sort of forced. Uh. So the solution isn't just to go out all the time. It's some sort of a mental attitude or something. Or a new gross is maybe I'm just unwilling to change my subconsciously or something. I'm willing to change. I don't know. I guess you're saying you've tried going through the behaviors of being interested in girls. Would you have anyway, because society demands it. Which brings another point. Is one of the big reasons for wanting to change is simply society's attitude toward the whole thing. Impossible situation for some people. They like to defy convention. And that's all right for them. But, um. For me it's not. Well, there's just such a social stigma attached to the whole thing. You get sort of tired of acting apart for. So that for you, one of the big reasons for wanting to change is the social attitude toward homosexuality. That's one of them. And uh. Another reason is uh. Simply that I don't think that it's rewarding. Uh. It just is not a very happy relationship. At least what I bet it isn't. And uh. Also I look at when I get older, does the uh, picture changes. I mean, when you're young it's one thing. When you're old it's horrible. Uh, the 40 ish and 50 ish men you see on the street said, it's just horrible. I don't want to be like that. I feel it isn't in itself fully satisfying now, but even more later weighty is the fact that if you look ahead, you don't like that at all. And from what I see, of course I have an entirely different perspective on. Ordinarily, uh. Heterosexual uh, relationships in my age group. And uh, from what I see of them, they're satisfactory. Although there's an awful lot of nonsense that goes on there that I think is kind of stupid. That that has the approval of society, for one thing. And, uh, still it seems to be workable. More workable, more, uh, satisfying relationship all the way through. Of course, a physiological element, which is simply. Who was it? Jeed tried to justify it. It just can't be justified. But that's outside of the realm of my experience. Yes. I sort of get the feeling that you're saying there are various cultural and intellectual considerations on this. Several of those are, uh, outside the realm of your own experience. It's a very loaded. Just to use the word. It's a very loaded word because when you say that you're queer, it automatically sets you apart. You lose your individuality immediately. And you become one of a horrible group. They say they're abnormal people, but they're really not. They are, but they aren't. They're perfectly ordinary in every other respect. Although their sexual outlook, of course, colors their outlook on everything else. And they'll be different from other normal people. But you feel it when you're labeled homosexual. Then it's as though you're no longer a person at all. That's why I don't like to use the word. Because you lose your name, you lose everything. I mean, if you. Label, that label really destroys you as a person. And just puts you in a class. Puts you in a class. That's. That's not accepted. No, Con. I myself haven't been put in that category ever. Because I've always been acting apart. I've never had any homosexual associates, really. But yet when you hear people talking, you always make the connection mentally. Of course, they don't know they're talking about you. Maybe it's me that puts myself in the class alone. I don't know. But at least you're saying other people haven't put you in that category. It's just the realization within you of what that would mean. The only reason they don't is because they don't know. But they would, except for a very. Rare few of them. Ah. That is the feeling, though, that if they really knew, then they would put me in this awful disapproved of class. That is, with a lot of them, certainly with a family. It's true. A lot of my friends is true, but some of them isn't true at all. Well, I don't know where to go on. I go in cycles of times when I'm more attracted to women. Sometimes almost entirely heterosexual in outlook. That happened at school. I was before I came down here. But for a while, for short while. But then I also lapse back into it. I don't know why, but maybe it's a retreat or something, or an escape. That's the kind of thing m you don't understand. All you're quite sure of is that your feelings do change to some degree from time to time. It is that there have been periods when you have felt quite strongly heterosexual in your interests. And other times when I guess it feels to you a little bit as though it was a going back or something like that. Oh, this is just too much. Why do I bother? That sort of thing hits me when walking down the street or something. I just give up. What am I going to all this effort for? Yeah, what is the use? It's mostly entirely mental. I mean, it has nothing to do with relationships. Everything is just a service. But of course, two, lots of people, they'd say, well, that's absolute nonsense. You're not homosexual. You don't act that. You don't go around with men. But it's the mental attitude. It's ridiculous that you feel, if it's true, that this doesn't have too much to do with what goes on outwardly in their relationships. It's something within me. Yeah. For those people that can see it. It's evidenced outwardly by a certain lack of sincerity, maybe, or something. A lack of. It's just, as I say, it's an act. And it gets to be, uh, an act which I put on, I guess, for, um, society. And it gets to be, uh, dry because it takes a lot of energy. I mean, you have to be. It's hard to keep putting on an act. You also have to be thinking about not what you would ordinarily do, what you would naturally do, but what is the accepted thing to do. And you have to do that feel. In a sense, that you're always following a fairly involved script. Yeah. Whereas motivation is one thing and on the other hand, is, uh, purely insincere actions that have no real basis on my personality or something. There's nothing. You are going in one direction, but this act that you can put on is going off in another direction. Sometimes they come together. Sometimes they go further and further apart. When they go further apart, I think I stop dating and, uh. Um, look at that. I have all sorts of devices for escaping. I go to movies, I read books. I do all sorts of things that are. Yeah, I had it, like, despaired shortly after I came down here to school because I went back in my old routine of constantly seeking some sort of entertainment or some sort of something to get away from myself, I guess, something, although I don't really like to use that. Is this what she's saying, though, that when you and this false front get too far apart, then it just seemed very necessary to you to get some kind of escape entertainment. And that you realize, evidently realize really suddenly. That's what I went through when I came down here to go to school. Yes, I joined a fraternity down here, uh, which is all right for the first while. But they insist that you fall in the mold. And you have to go to parties every weekend. You almost have to have a date. And I don't always feel like having a date. So the upside of that was, although I told everybody that I got out of the fraternity for other reasons, uh, that was, I guess, I suppose, the actual reason that I left. Because I simply didn't feel like playing the game all the time. That's what you have to do. I just cannot keep up this act permanently. Definitely. I can't do it all the time. I don't think I could as an actor. I suppose wasting time comes into it somehow. I waste worry, uh, about wasting a lot of time. When I should be practicing, I'm doing something else. I'm going to a movie. I'm doing almost anything to waste time. I wonder why that is. Is it in these periods you feel almost compelled to waste time? Is that I feel more compelled to waste time than I do to practice. And that I don't practice that much. And then I think about, oh, my gosh, look at the amount of time that slipped by. And I get to start getting either depressed or angry or something. You really scold yourself if you waste too much time. Um, yeah, I get quite mad at myself. And then I don't remember what happens. I turn over new leaf for about one day or something like that. Then I start wasting time again. Although I always manage to pull through school because school isn't anything much. My great battle is my piano. That's the thing you have to keep at all the time. I don't know. I've gotten further and further away from it. I mean, putting in the time I should. I suppose it also. I don't see how. Maybe I associate playing the piano with something. But, uh, I waste time when I'm sitting there practicing. I mean, I put. I improvise. I do almost anything but what I should be doing. Why is it I somehow feel the two are tied together? Sounds as though right in the piano playing. You certainly experience this impulse toward time. Wasting in the playing. In the practicing. Well, I mean, in the practicing. Playing is. The playing is a different thing. Once I get something under my fingers so that I can play it, it's become a sort of a staple thing. And it's become part of the past, which I don't mind going back to. It's the new things again that I'm also afraid of. Not afraid of tackling, but I want to get out of doing. Maybe that's how it ties in. I get a new piece and I putts around it till I more or less can play it. And then I really can work on it. Because it becomes so much easier. Whether it's the newness of it or what that brings us about, at least there's a feeling that whatever you do in your practicing is tied in in some way with a lot of other things. I wonder if it's tied in with the idea of changing and being, ah, afraid. Or being sort of not knowing how or something. How do I ever get a new piece done under those circumstances? It's quite important because it takes me much longer time than it takes other people to do a thing. Once I get it done, though, I can do it quite well. There is this feeling there that changing yourself to play a new piece. Or getting into this new experience is something for you. Is slow and difficult and like changing yourself. Yeah. And then I have great moods of depression. I don't know. I haven't had any since I've come down here. At least not very one or something. But I have tremendously depressed moods. I think those are when I just lose. I've been going around in circles for a long, long time or something. I just don't have any clear vision at all. Maybe I get depressed about that. I don't know. Don't feel that you understand them though. Maybe it's when you've been going around in circles for a long time. But at least there, uh, are times when you just feel terribly down. Uh uh. When I was in high school, I was able to think quite clearly. And fortunately I can still remember the experience. And now when I can't about anything. School. Reading a book is more or less a matter of just reading the words and letting it soak in. It's not read from very much of a critical approach, I don't think, the way I used to. And that bothers me too. Where I used to be pretty clear and sharp and confused and. Yeah, that's. Consequently I feel that I bungle everyday things because I'm not able to think or something. If I thought clearly what I would come up with. Just muddle through. I don't really do things clearly or well. Not as well as I could do it. It. Mhm. I forget some of the things that I wanted to bring up because I'm not in an especially disturbed state right now. I've been going off fairly well, but occasionally I have things where I get a rush of ideas that I want to talk with somebody about. I can't remember some of them. I had a great deal of trouble with my family this year at home. Uh, but it's funny, when I'm out of the situation, I'm not bothered by it anymore. I almost forget what it was that was causing the difficulty in the first place. Some of those things that can seem very distressing at the time, and you just love to have a chance to talk them out. I was always in state of some, well, just in a state about something or other at home. And then now I can't remember what they were about. You can hardly, hardly remember clearly what all the strain and stress with your. When I get in a depressed mode, it's the same thing. When I get out of it, I can't remember what I was depressed over, but shooting. I'll be in another one in a week or so, maybe a lifetime. I don't know. Maybe you get into them by choice or something. Maybe. I don't know. Might be that that's escape too. I'd rather just give up trying to think about it and I just get in a mood or something. I've never thought about them carefully when I'm in them. I don't know what constitutes one of my depressions. I've noticed it before, though, that as soon as they're over, I can't remember what they were about. Whatever the experience is, in these kind of blocked times, at least when you're out, it's as though you had no recollection. Or else I can remember the thing that caused it, but I can't remember it in the same frame of mind ever since then. Uh. And when I'm out of them, they ridiculous. They're very silly, trivial things, but they get magnified when I go into a depression and that's all I think about. This. Guess you're saying that perhaps objectively they really may be trivial things, but when you're in that mood, they're enormous things. Yeah. I can't entirely discount them because, um, as I say, they'll happen again. They usually happen later on. It must be some sort of a mental attitude, a way of, uh, mental approach caused by something. I don't know. Or I'll just pick on any incidents as an excuse to descend into a depression or something. I don't know. You saying it could be that if I really am in a mood to be depressed, I'll find something depressed about anything. I don't know. Seems like this is miles away from the subject. But it's still, as I say, I think they're probably all related. So I might just as well present the whole picture. Maybe I'm roaming around, but I'm sure it's all tied together. Yeah. Yes. I'm all one person as far as I know, physically. Sometimes feel like several different people mentally. But. I wonder about this idea of clear thinking, whether that would. Whether that is just a mental laziness. Or whether it's also tied in with. Whether. If I get out of this, will I be able to think clearly? Whether I'm just all muddled because of one central problem or whether I'm using it as an excuse to be mentally lazy or something. I don't know. There's a vague feeling there that somehow the two things are. They are related. Yet maybe I just try to, uh, let myself get away with a lot because I serve a difficult situation. Maybe I feeling sorry for myself. I don't know. That's what you're saying. That perhaps you use what you see. As your central problem as kind of an excuse for the fact that you're mentally lazy. Yeah. I don't really feel it when I'm reading a book, I want to. Get as much out of it as I can. I want to read it critically. And when I'm reading it, I'm thinking about wanting to do it. Yet I still don't do it. Maybe I just don't know how. It might be a lack of method or something. I thought of that and I told my piano teacher and she told me to read Playdoh. So I'm reading Playdoh. But the fact that I'm not reading. Very critically means that I'm not going. To get much out of play doh as far as the method goes. Because you have to be pretty sharp. I don't think it's all a method problem. There's an awful lot of laziness involved. Doubt if it's just kind of mechanical difficulty or using the wrong method or something. But more of it. There's something deficient in you in that respect. Uh, no. Well, deficient in the sense that I'm lazy. Yeah. I can only think of that one word to describe an awful lot of things that I do. And I of course rationalize them right after I do them. Uh, the fact that I didn't get up this morning in time to make class or something and I rationalize it while I was up late last night or I had a bad week or something, uh. And yet then shortly after I tell her, no, that's not true. It's just because you're so damn lazy. Won'T get up or something that you. Can make excuses for yourself. But still underneath that is a very strong feeling. You are lazy. Evidence in the amount of time I can spend sleeping. Well, I can sleep very easily all day, more or less doze and daydream all day and I haven't thought of being released many of the time that I spent till about one or 02:00 Saturday morning sleeping after going to bed at something like twelve or one the night before. And when I wake up I get very angry that I've wasted all this time and get by my bed. I just turn over. Oh, well. I guess you feel that this ability to sleep or daydream or a combination of the two, it's just real proof that you are lazy. Maybe I want to sleep again. I don't know. Maybe that's another thing. Maybe what? Maybe I want to sleep. Maybe I would rather sleep than do what I should be doing. If I were up I would be practicing something or procrastination is a big part of it. I love to put it in on. Maybe I really choose to sleep rather than the other alternatives. Yeah. It's not a very conscious choice though. I don't know. But I do feel that all these things maybe are tied in with one metal attitude. Maybe, uh, the homosexuality isn't the central issue. I don't know because there's all these other side issues. That's just the one that seems the biggest because that's the one that society doesn't condone. Whereas lots of people sleep their classes, lots of people, uh, don't read a book with any great care, go to too many movies or something like that. Sounds as though you're wondering. Isn'T it perhaps some. One unified problem and maybe. It isn't as much, uh. Maybe it's just the fact that some are brought into relief by the way other people think about them or something. Some problems would have sharper social aspects and some would not. But isn't there really in me one quite unified problem, whatever it is. Well, there might be. I don't know. It certainly seems to be some sort of a pattern. Never thought of it before. And I, uh, never brought them all together and considered that each one has a sort of a common element. Yeah. I've always thought of them separately. But. There does seem just be some sort of a common element. The fact that waking up to face a new day is almost too much to be born. Something like that. Maybe that's another retreat from what's new. By rights, I should be a political reactionary, but I'm not. Mmhmm. At least there's a kind of vague feeling that all these different things may be quite tied in together. In that dreading to wake up and face a new day is not as dissimilar from some of these other problems as it might be. Yeah, that's true. It. Can'T understand what would cause something like that. Of course that's looking for the cause. That's not looking. It's the way I am. Uh, I can't. I've tried turning over new leaves, and that simply doesn't work. Or maybe it hasn't worked yet. You can't turn over a new leaf and everything and write letters when you're supposed to and not put off anything. I guess what you're doing is sort of trying to feel out the implications of this and realizing, well, certainly this doesn't change just by saying, okay, now, tomorrow I will change. No, it doesn't work. I don't know why it doesn't. But sometimes it, uh, does work for a while. It's always for such a short while. I always want to lapse back into the way they were. I seem to want to slide back or something. It's also true composition. When I'm writing a piece or something, uh, I, uh, sort of hastily put down a new idea. And then I will do lavish all sorts of time copying it. I'll rearrange it. I'll do any number of things with this one idea that's come. But I don't want to go on and write the, um, succeeding developments of it or something like that. If you've taken one step forward, I want to stay. You'd like to spread out. Let's not move forward the whole situation. Whereas most they keep insisting that you write the whole mess as fast as you can and then go back and work details. But I will copy, I think, half a dozen times before I'll go in and do something else. Need two or three versions of it. Same situation. See, there again, that's kind of the. Same pattern as a fiance. It's the new. That's what all sort of writes. Sort of seems to be sort of an obsession. Sort of feel as though it's a surprising extent. To which this does seem to be a theme. Of being afraid of the new day, the new task. It's been as long as I can remember it too. Uh, well, no, that's not true. When I was in high school, I enjoyed coming back for another year. And I also enjoyed the. At least, I think I did. Of course, at the time I probably didn't. As you look back, you always think that this was much better than what is now. But it wasn't always true. Remember very distinctly in my senior year in high school. That I was thinking how much better the years before were than this year. And then I all of a sudden thought, well, in a few years I'll be thinking this was just about as fine as anything I ever had. You don't remember the mental environment that you were in at the time or something? I don't know. Or that you looked at these things the way you looked at them at the time. You just remember what's good about them or something. You sort of realized that even back there. The past tended to look better. And yet that you might have been really deceiving yourself about that. But when it was the present, maybe it wasn't so hot. Yeah. I see our time is about up for today. Oh, is it? Would you like to come back at 1130 next? 1130 next Saturday? Yeah, that would be fine. Okay. And I'll try and make it on time. Try to be ready. Okay. Uh, I think that this was a somewhat characteristic first interview. Um, I'm sure that the development of it follows the kind of thing that one often sees. Namely, first, my problem is a certain label. And then gradually the individual begins to get more and more into his experience. And begins to see that perhaps the problem is not that labeled thing an erosis. Or homosexuality or inferiority complex or whatnot. But the problem lies more in his total experience. And, uh, it seemed to me that this boy began to, um. Recognize something of the patterning of his experience. That there were themes and threads running through his life. That, um. Were perhaps in some total sense. More important than the thing that he saw as as the problem. I think as far as the relationship was concerned. It seemed to me easy, but not deep. Um, as is more and more true of people who come for help these days. He seemed to be prepared for the counseling experience, evidently through this talk with his friend. And so it starts off easily, but certainly without a great deal of emotional depth in the relationship. Um, I would say that from the point of view of the therapeutic process, what we've seen here is simply the very beginning of a relationship and also perhaps the beginning of the individual's exploration of his life and of his own experience. And, um, he seems to be, uh, finding, as is so often true, that though by himself he simply goes round and round in circles in such exploration, the moment he begins to express himself in a relationship, then somehow there does get to be forward movement. I think that he felt that he saw a few things about himself in this interview he hadn't been aware of before. Uh, I would say that this is surely no more than the nearest start on a therapeutic experience, but that perhaps.
