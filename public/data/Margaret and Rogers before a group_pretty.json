  "text": "It. This recording is being made for purposes of research, study and teaching. It may not be sold. First of all, I want to try out the microphone. We, uh, only have one microphone, so I'm going to have to put it back and forth. Can you hear? Does somebody know how to turn it on over there? It's on. It's just not loud. 123-412-3412 341-234-1234 we'll, we'll try using it. Uh, now I'd like to take a few minutes to get closer to myself and forget the microphone and forget the audience. And maybe you'd like a minute or two like that too. Mhm. Mhm. Okay. I don't know what you might want to talk with m me about, but I'd be glad to hear. I think one of the things I wanted to. Why I volunteered or why I thought it would be good for me to be here, because I'm probably the rawest or freshest subject in the room. I have no professional background. I'm, um, just the housewife. And so that I thought that might be helpful for everyone, and certainly it would be for me. I'm really pleased to know that you're not professional. You're just a person. When you talked, uh, of your wife, Carl, and I couldn't help identifying a little. I thought that had been my role. And I would hope that I had done it as successfully as I think she has. And I have some doubts about that. I have the feeling of being close to you in age. Closer than many of the younger people here. And when you talked about your sight and, oh, dear, I so badly. And because my eyes are the most important thing I have, and my books are so important. And that's been my fear for a long time. And when you brought it up, that really scared me terribly. Terribly. That was something that really touched you where you live. M. It really did. I don't really know what. I can't give you my life either. In this little thing. I don't quite know where to begin. I, uh, thought about your wife and her role and my own. And I had many regrets. I mean, that was okay. And I did, uh, a pretty good job. Not a terrible job, but I didn't do enough. For me, that wasn't enough. And I have terrible regrets. So that if you had it to do all over again, you might do it differently. I would hope so. If I had it to do over again, I would have to know what it was going to be like now. But right now you're living with certain regrets, not for what you've done, but for what you haven't done and haven't been. That's why I get it. That's exactly it. Not for what I've done, but for what I haven't. And I think I could have. I had all the potential and simply only the daring and the brave and the courageous and the intellectual were doing it then. Yet this was playing my role, so I can't lay too much blame on me, I know, but I have the feeling that I've gone through life, uh, using my husband and my children as the reason for not doing that doesn't help. That's one aspect which you do feel not only regret, but maybe a little ashamed or something. That you've, uh, used them as the excuse for not meeting life on a more daring basis. Not a good way to be feeling at this point. I look at you, and you're ongoing and you're still doing, and I have the feeling that I haven't the energy and I haven't the fight, and it's too late. And I don't really think I can start now. I guess that feeling really stops here, that it's just too late to begin to live. Yes, there are the wonderful moments when I push that all aside and I say, that's ridiculous. It isn't. In life, there's so many wonderful advantages about being almost 70. And they're truly. Oh, I think your perspective is so much wider, and you're not as righteous as the young. So part of it is good. And there are moments, as I say, when I feel the courage to do. And then this comes m over me, and it's late and I'm tired, and I'll just get into bed with a book and forget about everything else. So there are two sides to it. I don't quite know how to resolve it. I'd love to have somebody either taking me by the hand and pulling me out into the world or getting behind me and pushing. I can't seem to do it alone. That's what you need, is help from outside to get out into that current of life. That's exactly it. And I'm a little ashamed of that too. Why can't I do it by myself? And why have I never been able to do anything by myself? That's not a new problem. It really is an old one. It really is an old one. That was quite a strong statement that you'd never have been able to do anything by yourself. No, really. Not really. I don't think I'd be driving a car today if a friend of mine hadn't 30 years ago said, let's go take driving lessons. And I've signed us up, really. I'd be walking or waiting for the bus. And that pattern has really followed. I'm a perfect example of somebody who has never done anything. Things have happened to her through somebody. Else'S, but not on your own initiative. Never. I even got married because the man wanted me so much and how could I say no, so help me? That's. But what you're asking is give me a push or pull me, right? You'd like so much to continue that same pattern that's been your life all through right here. To continue it still. Even here, even here, right now, in this moment. Yeah, of course I use my years of saying, but m I'm in this thing. How do I switch into another track? If I had done it 30 years ago or 20 years ago, I probably could have, I say, from the comfort of not doing it now at 69, not liking myself terribly and yet being here this week and I've been going from really joy and exhilaration to complete fatigue and so many new things and so many new thoughts that I'm exhausted and exhilarated all at once. And so I know how I would really like that world out there. I really would. And it would really hold the years back. I know that this taste is very tempting and it would be a way of keeping young. Right? And I'm sure of that. I looked in the mirror this morning and one of the tests of coming here, and this is absolutely ridiculous, is that I haven't gotten up before 09:00 in years. So the fact that I can and I did it opens up a whole lot of other things. The whole mornings of my life now have been given it back to me. I don't have to get up at nine and sit over that coffee for 2 hours and then face the day and gratefully a very short one because I'll be back in bed at eight with a book. I don't want to. So by coming here you've already taken a step. Yes, I've taken a step. I know that I can get up in the mean. It sounds ridiculous. It's big to me. Somebody had asked me to go to South Africa this winter and I said I couldn't go on one of those tours and get up in the morning and get on buses. And I called her last night and I said, you know, I think I can go. Ahead. You've taken two steps that was supposed. To getting up early. Just one? No, because calling her and saying I can do it is a second step. Yeah, I think of it as the one step. Okay. That thing threatens me, so I have to keep talking, whether I have anything to say or not. No, you can keep quiet as long as you wish. I think it's part of that whole pattern, isn't it? That if you asked me a question, I'd be more comfortable. Just like the push. Your whole life is really a way of asking people, please, take the lead. Mhm. Take the lead. Take care of me. Hold it. Hold my hand. I recently returned from Toronto, which is my home, and spent some time with a, uh, friend of many, many years, who I think I leaned on too, in the always, she's the one who made driving arrangements. And, um, I suddenly realized that somewhere, somehow, I had changed. I had grown. She's worse. She seems to me suddenly so timid and a really little old lady, and I'm not quite as much as she is. And it was comforting and it was reassuring. And at the same time I was angry because. I just suddenly realized. I was angry because had she dragged me off of school 20 or 30 or 40 years ago, uh, I would have been in a better place. I was still expecting somebody to do it. And I realized that she could never have done it. She wasn't the one. So I found myself angry at my good old friend, instead of angry at Marion. Why didn't she lead me into school and other things? That's one side of it. And the other side of it is, I really have grown more than she has. She's a little old lady, I'm not. Yes, I was very aware of that. That was good. That was a time when you felt good about yourself. Yeah. I'm wondering whether. Do all people sometimes feel good about themselves? Sometimes feel terrible about themselves? It seems to me I block to myself. Mostly I don't feel good about myself. But a few times, shortly after my husband's death, uh, when I got through the wonderful, oh, I loved being the poor new widow. Oh, I loved it with everybody being there to that. And then when it was, that part was over, and I had to go out and start doing things I had never done before, like some business things, like lawyers and accountants, and I handled it. One day I came home from it and I went to the bathroom and I looked in the mirror and I was so surprised to see that wrinkled face. I felt 20 years old. I went, how could that be the way? Because inwardly I was feeling so triumphant and so good. And I thought, there must be a way to hang on to this, to go through life feeling this way or more often this way. So it means going out and taking risks and being frightened. That really is your search, isn't it? To retain that 20 year old feeling by doing new things. Mhm. That's my search. But I search like this. That says it so well. So how do I get the backbone or the strength or to really start and to do, I mean, so well, I resolve that I'm going to do it tomorrow. And of course, tomorrow I don't. I think that it's ridiculous and what am I proving? And it took me all right. And then, of course, there's that other side of it. When I do do, when I do something like even come to this, it's not even. It was a big step for me. Uh, I could feel my children's pleasure and pride in that I was doing this. So I thought, why it's even doing something for them when I do, it's not only for me. M my 25 year old grandson said, go do it, mangy. You're great. I'm so proud of you. And that's a lovely, lovely. Not only lovely, but it's setting a model for them, isn't m it? I know, and that makes me very uneasy. And another thing about setting a model. What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do when I feel rotten and I feel old and I want somebody to. I want my child to do, and I can feel, um, their impatience and I can feel that their fear. Is this how I'm going to be when I'm 69? And I resent it. I'd like to be able to be comfortable and old and complainy once in a while. And you're not sure whether you can accept that part of yourself that wants to relax and be tired and be 69? Well, I can't if they're so disapproving, that makes me feel very uncomfortable, and then I'm giving them a, uh, terrible role to emulate. You feel that to be doing both risky things and being 69 and relaxing, that double thing is not a good model for them. No. I think I should be all brave and free and have the wisdom of my years. You think you should always be strong and risking and daring? That's what I would love to be, yes. Almost. At least half the time. Not just that little bit. You'd settle for 50 50? I think I'd settle for 50 50 very gladly. Yes. I was very frightened to come up here, Harry? I'm not at all. It was a risk before it happened, but not, uh. Oh, that's wonderful, isn't it? That's very much like the things I'm not risking. That wouldn't be so frightening. Once I did them, wouldn't be at all. I tried to go back and wonder why. I've always been timid, lazy, undisciplined. All these. My lips are so dry. I guess I had know and I go into my childhood, which is a wonderful, you talked of yours. I had two very loving parents and wonderfully loving a sister and brother. I talked to my brother, uh, who lives in New York last week, and he wasn't there. Must have been something wrong with our relationship. We never quarreled. He says, I can't remember once in all our years that we raised our voices to each other. And I says, well, why can't we just enjoy that rather than thinking about it? There I was with these loving, tender, uh, maybe overly protective parents and, um, went from that house to my husband's house. So that I feel that there's a whole lot of world I don't know anything about except through books. You went from one loving home to another loving home. And that's been it. Being looked after and looked after. I'm an absolute terrible example of the woman who's always been looked after, until recently. And now she's been taking risks. A few. Oh, very, so very few. The Chinese have a saying, a journey of a thousand miles starts with one step. Yeah. Mhm. So I've taken one. You. One of the things that's troubled me about this week is that I find myself being a spectator at an entertainment. And I would like to be feeling more. And it seems that I'm not. I have compassion with some of the younger people. I think. I think about my children or grandchildren, but I don't really like sitting back and not feeling and just observing. And I don't know how to get those feelings feeling again. It's not that you've never experienced them, but it seems as though now you're in the spectator role. Yeah. And I always thought one of the nice things about growing old is being in a bathing chair and being a spectator. But I don't really like it. No, it's not. It seems to me you're having a number of feelings right now. You felt frightened. You still realize you are frightened underneath, you're risking, you're feeling comfortable. All kinds of different feelings. Mhm. Right here. Yeah. Well, to some extent, I've been feeling all kinds of feelings all week, truly. But, um, I almost envy when I see somebody break into tears or somebody voices filled with emotion, and I don't seem to be able to feel that deeply about anything. Can you scold yourself a little for that? Yeah, certainly. I mean, I must be a very insensitive, miserable, cold person. Why aren't I? It. I'm not thinking of anything, and I feel as though it's my duty to be sitting here and bringing out some parts of myself to be examined. And right now, there is nothing there for you to examine? No. If there is, I can't get at. It. So now I'm going to stop feeling apologetic and perhaps somebody else should have had this. Who could pour out a lot of stuff. You really aren't good enough to be here. Yeah, I guess that's it. Or good enough or. Yeah. Unfeeling. So unfeeling that how can I be. It? I have the feeling that everybody in the room, if they were sitting here, would know exactly what they're supposed to do. They would know which piece to bring out for you to discuss. You're sure a professional would do the job better of being a client? Yeah. And that really, my early thought was that I'd be very good, but because of my lack of experience, I don't know, because I'm letting the show down. That's it. You feel you must put on a show? Well, if this is a learning experience. Well, maybe show is not quite the word, then I am not contributing enough. I guess I feel that way about a lot of things. That's not a new feeling for you to feel. I'm not really good enough for this situation. I'm not contributing enough. I'm not feeling enough. I'm not risking enough. Yeah. So in those moments, you feel m I'm really not worth very much. Yes, I feel that way. I would say I feel that way more than 50% of the time. And, of course, the times when I don't feel that way are so wonderful and lovely that I would love to have blank and happy. But there is a large part of you that feels. No, I'm not really much. Yeah. There's a large part of me that's constantly struggling to be more or appear to be more. And appearing to be more is very exhausting when it's not really there or when you don't think it's there. That's one of the most tiring things I know. Yeah. I discovered that's somebody this week said uh, when I said I was feeling depressed and they said they thought. Yeah, they thought I was really way up there and I said, I guess I'm a good actress and I really hadn't thought about that before, but I guess that part of it is. But even when you're depressed, you give other people a feeling that things are fine. Well, I think I want that facade, unfortunately. I guess part of my life, my new lifestyle is a lot of little old widows for friends and they m complain an awful lot. They're always talking about their aches or their pains or their children or who are certainly another pain when I'm with them, I find myself doing this and I can't bear it. I come home and I'm very depressed and I'm very bored and very irritated. And I think I put on. I tried to put on the other facade because I hate to be one of them. I hate it. Uh. I don't know whether it will help you any or not, but I don't have any friends my age. I can't stand them. You know, my mother. My mother, who was, uh. A wonderfully positive lovely lady. Lovely lady would say, would always have young friends too. And she would say, I really can't bear people at my age. They depressed me so. And her friends were always young. Yeah. And my friends are too. The occasional positive side of me that my young friends like and I work at when I'm with them, I guess I work to keep that. I would say I have friends from 30 and up. All right. So I'm coming to the conclusion I'm not quite as empty and awful as I think. And if I can only do that moving myself because nobody's going to do it for me. That sounds sort of like a resolution about a new kind of life. Yes. I've been feeling it coming, uh, this past week that I feel more alive. And I have to get back to that. Getting up in the morning, it's a confirmation that I feel more alive. So I know that the only way I'm going to continue to feel that way is to get out there and do and be. Yeah. The contrast that you gave of the picture of yourself getting up late, doddling 2 hours over coffee and wondering how you could spend the time till 08:00 in the evening is very different from the woman I'm talking to now. Yeah, I feel very different from that woman. I'm absolutely thrilled that this morning at 730 that I was on the telephone getting in those before eight long distance calls and I haven't uh, spoke to my daughter amongst many people this morning and she said, I have never. Firstly, I've never spoken to you at 730 in the morning in my life. And I never heard you sound so alive and well. So that was good. I think we're going to have to stop in a couple of minutes. Is there anything more you want to say? No, just. Thank you very much. And I feel this was a lovely gift that I was given, being able to sit and talk with you. I feel it's been a privilege to see an older person who is young. And I know I'll change my statement of a moment ago when I said I didn't have any friends my age. I do have one or two, but they are young people in heart. It's been nice talking with you. No, because I think probably the group would like to know, after you've thought a minute or two about it, how you felt about this. And then I'll tell how I saw it and then we'll let them in on it. Well, as I said, I was petrified to come up here and I could feel my heart pounding so that I thought my voice wouldn't be heard and my mouth drying, which it still is. And I think I didn't discover new things, but I confirmed where they were resolved for me that it's absolutely essential for my well being. And I guess I shouldn't even know. I don't think I will even bring my kids or my grandchildren. It's just for me. I think it's for me that I feel I have. I have the time and I'm in fairly good health. And damn it if I don't do it now. That's why I think I'm here. I love living now. Love that title. Redfin. Well, I think this is a delightful picture of someone who's going to live young. And, um, I realize it was different from what I might have expected. I guess you were asked if you would be a client, is that right? Um. That's one reason why you had a hard time finding things to talk about at times. Uh, where, I guess usually before, uh, someone has asked who would. Who would volunteer to be a client. And so that's usually someone with a problem. But it's. Excuse me. You mean I have none? No. It's the reason why it took you longer to think through what they were. I think that, uh, the gradual dealing with their feelings of not liking yourself, the, uh, willingness to take risks and realizing that it is up to you. Nobody's going to pull you or push you. Uh, all of that seemed very important to me. And I don't know, I ended the interview just feeling I wish you well on your trip. I guess now we'll let the audience in and see what they might have to say or ask. Carl gave you a gift, and I just want you to know. You gave me a gift. Isn't that nice? This was very moving to me because I'm at the stage where I have to decide what I'm going to do with my life, and I see how important it is not to hide behind my family. I'm running out of excuses. I'm at that stage and tell.",

And, um, I suddenly realized that somewhere, somehow, I had changed. I had grown. She's worse. She seems to me suddenly so timid and a really little old lady, and I'm not quite as much as she is. And it was comforting and it was reassuring. And at the same time I was angry because. I just suddenly realized. I was angry because had she dragged me off of school 20 or 30 or 40 years ago, uh, I would have been in a better place. I was still expecting somebody to do it. And I realized that she could never have done it. She wasn't the one. So I found myself angry at my good old friend, instead of angry at Marion.",

Oh, I loved it with everybody being there to that. And then when it was, that part was over, and I had to go out and start doing things I had never done before, like some business things, like lawyers and accountants, and I handled it. One day I came home from it and I went to the bathroom and I looked in the mirror and I was so surprised to see that wrinkled face. I felt 20 years old. I went, how could that be the way? Because inwardly I was feeling so triumphant and so good. And I thought, there must be a way to hang on to this, to go through life feeling this way or more often this way. So it means going out and taking risks and being frightened.",

There I was with these loving, tender, uh, maybe overly protective parents and, um, went from that house to my husband's house. So that I feel that there's a whole lot of world I don't know anything about except through books.",

Speaker B regrets that Speaker A didn't do enough.\n- Speaker B wants help from outside to get out into the world because she can't seem to do it alone.\n- Speaker B tells the interviewer that she feels angry at her old friend Marion because she didn't lead her into school and other things. She feels that she has grown more than she has.\n- Speaker B complains about her childhood. She went from one loving home to another loving home. She thinks she is an example of the woman who's always been looked after but now she's been taking risks.\n- Speaker B tells the therapist that she finds herself being a spectator at an entertainment. She doesn't like it and wants to be feeling more. The therapist thinks she is not contributing enough and letting the show down.\n- Speaker B tells the interviewer that she doesn't have any friends her age because she can't stand them. The interviewer thinks this is a delightful picture of someone who's going to live young.\n- Speaker B tells Carl that Carl gave Speaker B a gift because Speaker B is at the stage where Speaker B has to decide what to do with #B's life.",
