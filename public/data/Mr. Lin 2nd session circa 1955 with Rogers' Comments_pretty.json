  "text": "Is the second interview. We might have a little trouble hearing the quiet. Food. That I wasn't trying to force everything into a sort of, um, mold just to have it come out right. But I didn't come up with any alternative. But there's just the feeling maybe you were trying too quickly to see it all as a pattern or something like that. I wasn't exactly. It was just kind of sort of convinced myself that everything had happened or something. I'm not sure that it does. It seems a little bit uninterested. But I had a hair raising week, which is sort of typical. I put everything off until the last minute and paid the price for. It. I was thinking about that a little bit. It seems to me that I realized, uh. That, well, it's gotten to be such a habit putting things off. And, uh, I realized that, um. I have to pay for it eventually. But I still go right on doing it. I don't learn from experience. I wonder what makes me do that. This is me, all right. Putting everything out till the very last minute. And then having to pay the consequences. But not learning from it. Not learning from it. There's no sense to that. I know I should learn from it. And yet I will go right ahead and do the same thing. Monday was, uh. Well, I had a big, long, uh, moto in school counterpoint. And I, uh, naturally, uh, put off doing it until an hour before class. I had half of it done or something. And I thought I could whip it. Up in an hour. And so the upshot of it was I was tearing my hair out until I, uh, was too late to go to class. So I finished it and stuck it in the teacher's box. After great, uh, deal of, um, uneasiness or something. Um, uh, but the same thing, well, would have happened. I put off working on something else for Thursday until Wednesday night. Thursday morning, fortunately, the teacher didn't show up. But, um, that was so typical. You see, in the one instance I should have learned right there. That I should have sat down and worked on what I had for Thursday, Monday or Tuesday. But no, that's happened time and time again. So the question you're asking yourself is. Why do I live in this. Hanging on by my fingertips fashion or something. Just getting things in at the very last minute. Or even too late, uh, when I actually know better. The only thing I can figure out is that, uh. It tends to make life a great deal more difficult than it actually is. And that it might be some sort of self punishment or something. It certainly makes. Makes it much harder to get along. For a while it becomes very easy, it's very relaxed, there's nothing doing. Uh, but then for a few. Hectic. Uh, hours before class, it's horrible. Then of course I get nervous about it. And you're saying maybe I do this in some sense to make life more difficult. As though I deserved for it to be or something. Something like that. Exactly. Um. Oh yes. And then there's the business of not getting up for class. I did that twice, Tuesday and uh, Wednesday morning. But uh, I don't think that fits the pattern. I tried to make it fit last week. I was just. Maybe I. Wasn'T aware of um, what was going on. I don't know. Um, but I can't understand why I do that's. And then maybe these things are actually divorced from the central problem. It is. I guess at the moment the feeling is I don't see any real way of making sense out of all this, or whether all these different things are related or not. I don't know. Yes, as we tried to make m them last week. But actually it doesn't seem to me that um, um, these are actually the things that really bother me from day to day to day. They keep cropping up, whereas the other is, as I told you, that seems to be about the one valid point that seems to hold true is that possibly the only reason I had thought so much about it was that it was so accented by society, by uh, not being accepted. Mhm. But these other things are the things that keep going on and on. And am I getting this right? That if you were to ask yourself, well now, what really bothers me emotionally, it would be these day by day things? Is that what you're saying? Yeah. Not in the long run, but day by day they're what count. The things that I seem to get concerned about on a day by day basis are, why don't I get up? Why don't I get things in on time? Yeah, why don't I do them ahead of time so that I don't have so much, um, pressure all at one thing. And of course the upshot of that is that, uh, after I've been working under pressure for maybe terrific pressure for maybe one morning or something, the minute classes are over, I just want to coast. I don't want to do anything. And I tell myself that you need this relaxation, whereas it's just wasting time. And it. And it seems so stupid because I can't see why I can't just simply sit down and make myself check. But I don't seem to want to or something. Why would I follow a cursive action that intellectually at least, really seems quite stupid? Unless it is that, um. Unless it is that in some fashion I want to do things the way. I want to do it, that's the only feasible answer. But I guess if I'm getting it right, um, that seems like quite a logical answer. But it isn't something you really feel that you don't feel that you want to do things this stupid, uh, way or whatever. I don't know. Sort of confused. Whether. I don't know exactly whether it's conscious whether I want to really like this better than doing things the way everybody else does or not. That's about the only two things I've been able to think about, uh, all week. I couldn't seem to make much sense thinking about all the rest. I figured that. So if I did come to a conclusion that they're all the same problem. And that it all follows a pattern or something. But I still don't know what to do about it. There just doesn't seem to be any inner drive, um. Uh, all along the line to make, uh. Myself turn over and leave or something. I know I should, but there doesn't seem to be any inner compulsion. Maybe it's part of my philosophy. I don't feel that you can work for very long in purely artificial drive. That's people that take jobs that they don't really want to spend their life doing. I don't see how they can ever make it successful. Because there has to be something within yourself that is going to keep pushing you along all the time. So that you can say, I should turn over a new leaf. I should do things differently. But your feeling is that there is really nothing within you that really persistently wants to do. That's it. Yeah. I don't know what that's true. I don't know. Uh, what do you go about doing? Whether you, uh. Try and. Try and, um. Instill some sort of drive in yourself, it is natural. Or whether you try and find out the reasons why you live the way you do or something. I don't eradicate them. Oh, I had one good symptom, um, in reading this week. I started reading somewhat more critically than I have been. Which was sort of a step away from mental laziness. Or something very small and hardly noticeable. But it was encouraging. There's one little change that, uh. Very imperceptible to anybody else. Because I wasn't really going all out. But at least I was making somewhat. Of effort. When I was thinking a great deal about what, uh, went on in class. Which I do very rarely from time to time. No. But that was also very encouraging. Because. At least I got ideas. And um. They still somewhat unclear. But I didn't follow them up right away. I didn't sit down. But I guess you're telling yourself. Yes, there have been one or two little things, very small things that have been a little different during the week. And they were very encouraging. They were enough to keep me going along. Quite a good mood, actually. But to anybody else it would seem idiotic. They would just. I guess it sounds like it gave you very real pleasure. Even those things were quite small. Yeah, it really did. Um, because it's such a change from thinking about nothing. To start thinking about something. At least thinking. Because, uh. As I told you was one of the things I was worrying. It wasn't very clear and it wasn't very logical thinking. But it was sort of a step. Made it sort of possible to feel. Well, to some degree. Some of the time I have some focus. Yeah, that's exactly the illustration I wanted to point out. Uh. At times I, um, feel sort of confident in what I can do. But I, uh, see the thing as this. That I have mental faculties that are like a bunch of searchlights. As you see them before. When they're looking for a plane. They're all going in all different directions. When they find it, they all focus on one spot. And you see all these things focusing on one spot. Well, if I could do that, focus them, I think I could do whatever I wanted to. But I don't keep going off in all directions. I spend tons of energy acting. Or at least I think it must take some energy acting apart. Um, instead of, well, energy that I could use better somewhere else or something. And then, uh, getting an idea. I get lots of nice ideas. But I mentally, uh, too lazy to follow them up. And that's another. Just another searchlight that is a little bit off the beam at this time. But it's at least temporary focusing sometimes during this past week of these different wandering searchlights that, uh. Well, I don't say they focused, but that's an illustration of what I sort of graphically. That's more a picture of what you'd like. Is that right? Yeah, that is what I'd like. That's what I think. Then when I think I can do that, I think I'll be perfectly all right. But the thing is, I'm not all sure of where the point is. So maybe I, where do I want to focus? Where's the plane you're supposed to be focusing on? Which is certainly that's a pretty valid reason for not being able to focus. That if you don't know what you're looking for, it's not too surprising you haven't been able to find it. Sometimes it helps though, to follow sort of an abstract, um, concept or just sort of an analogy like that because you can at least get some sort of put the problem in some sort of form that you can see more clearly, almost a little bit more objectively than if you're out, um, uh, right in the middle of it all the time, can't almost see on the other. And then I'm almost afraid of forcing things into a mold that they don't fit. Whatever you do, you don't want to arrive at some pseudo solution, at a good workable solution. Isn't going to let me down. And I uh, was going to say, if you follow up that idea that that thing to do would be to look for the point, look for the reason, look for the um, focus. Um, in other words, the central problem. What is the central problem? And yet that sounds interesting. Um, and yet you don't want to follow truly abstract pattern. I mean you might be getting off track or something. It is. Define the central problem or issue. Yes, that's what you'd like, but you don't want to be deceived there either. By following something that seems right in the abstract. Yes, just because it fits in the abstract pattern. Uh, and it might not fit at all uh, in real life. As I said, it does sort of help to clarify. But it seemed last week when I left that I did have at least some sort of an idea that there was a central one big issue and all these other things sort of added weight to it. And I retrograded, I don't think that. It. Seemed then there is some central definable problem. Well, it seemed that all the evidence pointed to that. I'm not sure that I wasn't forcing the evidence. In other words, I'm not sure that it wasn't pseudo forced. That's it. And now this week you feel, well, I'm not at all sure that what I saw there was really deeply so. And I don't feel quite that way. Kidding myself alone a little bit. So I suppose the accomplishment is, Neil. Sort of a feeling. I took one step forward and one. Step back and I'm in the same place. Although, well, not entirely those. I see what I mean. I don't know where they came from, why I started reading critically. I took up a book that I had read before and liked very much. And I decided that I was going to read it again to enjoy it, and also to, um, see just exactly what the author was doing. I mean, what was he pointing out. In this sort of thing? I came up with some very general and probably not accurate at all conclusions, but at least I made the effort. You're saying there too, that the place I had sort of thought I had gotten, I don't think now I really got there. But the little changes that did occur, like reading, uh, more critically. I don't know where those came from. I don't know where they came from. They just happened, uh, they were very encouraging. Yes, that's the point. You. It. But it seems very hard to start from scratch. And something that you, uh, didn't really understand all of a sudden. To be able to figure this thing out clearly, I guess it's not going to come all of a sudden. Flash great light key again. Sort of realize it's most unlikely there will be any miracle on this. Oh, um, definitely because I've just gotten habits of thinking and anyway, I'm sure that sort of thing takes time, especially when you're right in the center of sort of a maelstrom. You don't. If you can be an objective outsider, it's different. You can form your own conclusions. But it's hard to see the way around in a sort of fog. That's part of the perplexity that you're expressing that when you're right in the middle of this storm. How do you know what way to go? How do you start from scratch? How do you start from scratch? I thought about that a lot too. After I dispensed with the idea that I got somewhere last week. I mean, not dispensed with it, but sort of decided that I went a little bit too far. Maybe something's it. I had a very strange experience last night, too. I was downtown. I was downtown for something. And, um, going back. I was coming back from the south side on the subway. And, uh, I got off downtown thinking, uh, I would go to a movie because I didn't want to, really didn't want to go back and practice, which was, of course, the thing I should have done. And so I got off and went sort of plowing around the loop, looking at all theaters. And, um, was sort of tempted by one. And I had just enough money to get to the movie and back to Anston on the subway. But, uh, I thought I'd walk around the block and let the temptation cool off a little bit more. And, uh. I was just sort of lost. I didn't quite know what I wanted to do. And, um. I knew, of course, that I should go back and be practicing. I should be practicing four or 5 hours a day. Of course I'm not. But, um. No, I gave up the movie idea and I went and had a coke at a drugstore and went back on the subway and practiced for an hour and a half. George. I was so completely lost. I didn't really know what I wanted to do, why, but at least I managed to overcome that. I felt real fun. There was some really strange quality to that, of feeling. I don't know. I don't have any idea what I really want to do. Yet somehow you wound up doing what. I thought was the right thing. And I gather there's some quality to it of I don't understand what this was all about. I don't understand. No. But the feeling then was absurd, funny. I mean, it's just sort of exemplary, symbolic or something of just being sort of lost, pulled between two things and, um. Really not having the remotest idea, um, which I wanted to do. And yet I knew all along what I should be doing in the absence of the desire that I went and practiced. But there was a feeling this symbolizes me somehow, uh, caught between different things and knowing perfectly well what I should do, but really not knowing at all what I want to do. Hm. That's when I have it very clearly figured out, mentally, what I want to do as far as life goes. But, um, at the same time. And I really want that, but at the same time, there seem to be awful sorts of forces that are keeping me from it or something. In other words, I know what I want and yet I don't know what I want. Very unclear. No, I think I really catch that. But, um, intellectually, you could say quite clearly what you want. And emotionally too. I mean emotionally. Um, insofar as I know what I enjoy doing all the time, as far as, uh, a life's work goes. But there are these other things that keep me from doing from day to day what I know has to be done to build up a background. Um, so it's more as though I really do know intellectually and emotionally where I want to get. But there seem to be forces in me that pulling the other way, uh, do something to mess it up on the way. Other forces that want to do something else. Um. Um. It seems to be a sort of a day to day living. Especially though these movies are actually, to me, what alcohol is to an alcoholic. I suppose it's just as in, um. I can't think of the word, but it's just not as good, um, for me. And habitual, sort of. It's a real addiction. Yeah. Uh, getting around something. And, um. Sometimes I just, uh, give up and say, well, what difference does it make? One, right now it's not going to make any difference in the long run. But of course they all add up, and they do make great difference in the long run. I always think of things in the long run. Um. Rather than. At least sometimes in the long run rather than in the short run. Because it sometimes gets depressing. And sometimes it seems about the only way you can know what to do. Since you do give importance to the long run. But I gather in the present, movies have this really compelling pull somehow. That has nothing to do with the movies, really. It's something you must have. Yes, actually. Because of course, along with this, um, business. I become sort of, uh. At least learned to know my way around them. And I know the difference between a bad film and a good film quite easily. Well, anybody does. Uh, and I enjoy a good film much more. But I will still go to a bad film just out of peak of something. I don't know how strongly you mean that last word. But as though sometimes just out of annoyance at something. Seems terribly silly that they could be such an addiction or something. But they are. And the same thing happens after Friday, especially Friday afternoon, when the whole week is over and done with it. At 1130. Uh, the impulse is. Well, I always do. I go over and have coffee with some friends from class. The impulse is just to stay there all afternoon talking and drinking coffee or something. Because, uh. I want to relax after more or less pushing myself. Except I don't really push myself like the other kids do it in a sense of a way. They push themselves fairly steadily and get things done. Uh, and I push myself tremendously hard. For about three or 4 hours at a time. Just in order to get in one thing. And it's a living from day to day proposition. The assignment falls due on one day. And I probably get up early in the morning and work at it until it's due or something. This gets back to what I said at the beginning. Yet I know all along that's making it much more difficult. I seem to find myself doing the things that I know make life, uh, tough and unsatisfactory. It. Seems to be just sort of going around in a circle. Now we've made this circle. And I'd say it sort of seems to avoid the central issue. Yet I don't know what the central issue is. So I can't say that all you. Have is the feeling that somehow I'm going round and round something, but I don't know what the something is. Yeah, I'm witnessed, uh, I mean, the thought process of just now starting from one point and sort of going around, coming back to that point. There's a lot of the way I do a lot of my thinking. That's what I run into quite often. In fact, most all the time. It feel. It's really. At least the last weeks was, um, different, um, in form, in that I sort of followed one idea down the line, might have been the wrong line, but at least it was. Pursuing a train of thought down one thing and dragging in all these other things just helped to push me down one sort of a road, dead end or not. But this other, you see, I drag in all the other things and I just sort of go around in a circle, come back where I started out from. But I guess you're saying. I guess you're saying I kind of like the fact that I was sort of organized last week and going somewhere. Even though maybe the somewhere I got, uh, wasn't quite where I thought it was. And this week I feel as though this is more characteristic of me. Yeah, much more. Just kind of going around in a circle and never getting to whatever it is that's in the center. But I don't like it. I don't like it because last week I was sort of encouraged just purely by the thinking, the thought process, moving. Down sort of feeling, look, I can go somewhere, do it. I was very surprised because I had. It. Seems to be largely, uh, a proposition that has to be thought out. And if I could get some sort of order or method that, uh, maybe I could think through it. But I can't think through it as this is. And this is largely the way I. Think when I'm alone. It seems to you what my situation needs is orderly thinking. And yet look what I do here. I'm doing the same kind of thing I always do. Just, uh, jumping around or something. Sort of more difficult when you're in the middle of it. Because that's the sort of thinking I do. Feeling that I'm, um, very much tied up in this whole thing. I don't get any clear perspective. I've been doing that for ages. Yeah. I guess you're saying I'm experiencing right now, right here, the thing that is almost most characteristic of me of just being in a kind of muddled situation and not really knowing what its shape is or what it has in it. And it's been that way. Well, it's been that way at least since I went to college. Confused? I told you before, my memory isn't too awfully good for what it was like in high school which I was attached also prousty and values too and say that these were the happiest days. Of my life and they weren't all. But after the fact they seemed quite wonderful and I can't remember how I felt. But I have an idea that it was sort of the same thing. Living from day to day and working only when I had time. It was absolutely imperative to get something handed to life. I can remember very well my two term papers that I wrote in my senior year in high school were both written the night before but I turned. Fortunately I came out very well on both but it was pretty agonizing when I did it. Such. You're pretty sure that the way it is now is very much the way it was in high school way? It's almost. But I don't think that's my way of doing things. I mean, I do think that there's another way that's much more satisfactory. I don't know. I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is my personality and the way I work. Everybody else can drop dead and they tell me because I see everybody else in action they seem to get through a lot better than I do. I don't know, maybe they don't. Maybe they all feel quite harassed at times. Maybe other people are muddled too. But I guess, um. I wasn't quite clear the way you put it. But what I got is, uh. This is the way I am. But don't misunderstand me. I realize there is a better way of doing things. Is that not exactly? Uh, yeah, this is the way I am and uh. Um. There is a better way of doing things but just because I've been this way for so long I wouldn't rationalize it and say that this is my personality, my way of doing things. This is not necessarily permanently me. Yeah, and yet it's been that way for a long, long time. It. But as I say, these things seems to have much a great deal of bearing on the thing because they're what bother me all the time. I always have to. Homosexuality, uh. I think of, incidentally, more. I mean, it used to be an obsession, but I think of it more occasionally now than these other things which keep cropping up all the time. It seems as though, uh. This feeling of confusion and muddling through and so on. That really seems to be the thing that is of more immediate concern than homosexuality, for example. Yet I want to change everything. I want to get rid of it all. But. Intellectually, I want to get rid of it all. I don't know what I want to do emotionally. Because if I had wanted to do it every way, I would have done it a long time ago. Something holds me back. I guess you're saying there I must be divided in some way. Because if I wasn't divided, I would have done whatever I think I want to do. Yeah, except that yet all people do very contradictory things. I mean, they do. Which leads you to believe that people are very seldom all of one mind. And they'll act with a certain degree of consistency according to one idea, and yet find them doing something that just completely doesn't figure in with a lot of things they've done before. So I can't hope that, um. By getting through this, I'll, um. Be all one mind or something. I figure this would be. But it's just wanting to get rid of these elements that I feel are holding me back, make them work for me instead of against me. Because I don't figure that I can get. Actually, I suppose you can't really get rid of them. But if you could find out what. They are and, um. Sort of bring them around. I'd like to know what it is in me that is working against me. And maybe those feelings or forces or whatever they are could be turned to constructive use. Is that. Yeah, because, uh. Uh. Sort of a conservation of matter principle, I imagine it holds true. Or at least it's such a nice theory that it's very pleasant to think that it holds through in the mind, too. And you don't get rid of things. They just. I. It put them some sort of video. But if that's true, there should, uh. I don't know how to go about finding out what these things are. They seem to be sort of an escape and a rationalization or something, always wanting to get away from these pressing problems. And if you could put a label to it or find out what they are, you could at least be able to meet them more or less head on. Some sort of clear vision, if you know what they are. If you don't know what they are. You're sort of mercy. But it seems to be a sort of a. Well, as I said before, just an escape. Um, wanting to get around, doing what I intellectually know what has to be done or what should be done. You feel I don't really know what these oppositional forces are in me. All closest I can come to pinning them down is that they seem to be some, um, desire to get away. Escape the pressures, escape the problems. Escape everything problems. I know that if there weren't any, um. If the university didn't grade on a grade point system and if they didn't give grades, I certainly wouldn't have all this pressure. Because I simply wouldn't do it. I would put, uh, everything off. And yet, when it came time to do something for class, I wouldn't have it done. Because I wouldn't see any sense in putting myself through all that ago. I would escape from it completely there. But I wouldn't have anything to show either. So that if it weren't for the pressures on me, I wouldn't do anything. Wouldn't do anything. Precisely. If I went out and lived on a shack as a hermit, I wouldn't have anything to show for about 50 years. Feeling is state of mind. That's not what I want, though. It isn't what you want. And yet there's also a realization. If I were just left to myself, I wouldn't do a damn thing. Actually. Yeah. Sounds horrible, but I guess that's it. Well, actually, I mean, figured out, uh. If I put myself. Put all this stuff off until the last minute. And I do it once and find out what horrible, uh, business it is to do it all at the last minute the next time it comes along, I'm, uh, going to say, well, nuts to it. We'll just skip this assignment and do the next one. And that pattern will continue. Because without the university or even society imposing regulations on me, um, I wouldn't see any use to put myself to all this, uh, trouble. Very uncomfortable business of conforming or something. Is this putting it too strongly that if there weren't external demands on me. There is nothing in me that would move forward? No. Um. Um. Oh, no, I'm wrong. Sort of wrong. Because I don't want to demolish myself completely. I mean, I want to say that there's something there that I see. I put this, uh. If there weren't external demands made on me, um, I would follow my, uh. Presuming I'm in my present state of mind, I would follow my present actions. In other words, I'd put everything off to the last minute. But when it came time to do it, I'd say, well, this is too much trouble. This is too much pain to put myself to, and I wouldn't get it done. And yet I'd still have the conscious realization that I wasn't getting anything out of the course. I wasn't doing anything which would follow through, straight through and everything. Uh uh. Well, I know enough to know what I should be doing. In other words, there's a part of me that wants to do it, and yet, according to my present behavior, I wouldn't do it at all. What was it you said before? It was, uh. That there would be nothing in you that would move forward, I guess is what I said. Yeah, there would be nothing that would push me forward. But there would be something that, uh, I'd want to still want to go forward, but I wouldn't do it. All right. In other words, then let me try rephrasing it to see if I can catch you feeling. If there were no external demands on me, I probably would do nothing. But there would still be in me some feeling that I should be moving forward. I get nothing done, but I'd still want to do something. There still would be a desire, even. Though very, very frustrated, if it worked for society even more than I am and probably more at ods with myself, I'd get maddered, madder myself. Time went out. Really. The demands on you to meet deadlines and so on are kind of fortunate for you because it saves you from facing the complete frustration you would feel if nobody forced you to do anything. And yet you felt very much divided within yourself. Yeah, I never thought of it that way before either, because I've always loathed all these things that are posed from outside social conventions that make me write letters to thank people for things and do it promptly. I've always thought it's a lot of hogwash, but I can see it's quite essential because they weren't there. I wouldn't do them feel. If it weren't for all these demands for conformity, I really would feel worse off inside than I do now because, um. I wouldn't do them out the goodness of heart because it's too much trouble. And yet I really would have enjoyed having stayed at a person's house. But I wouldn't want to take the trouble to thank social convention. So they're just using that for an example. You would kind of feel more deeply torn in feeling. I did enjoy it. And did appreciate it, but still knowing you would do nothing about it. Do nothing about it. So there seems to be a little bit more sense to some of these things than I previously thought. It's unfortunate because it shows how I've been rational. That is, to see some sense in what you've been saying makes you a little more aware of some of the ways in which you've deceived yourself, is. That I've been yelling about um. For years, I've been yelling about the university and why everybody's after a grade. Well, I still. But I can't really stick with that. Right down the line now because the work that I haven't. You have been protesting and protesting these social demands. And now I realize that without them I might be more unhappy than I am with them. I hadn't noticed that. I see our time is up. You wanted to say something more? No, I think I seem to accomplish something at the 11th hour, but. That'S. Next week at the same time. Let's see. Yes, okay. That's the 2020. Okay. Oh, if you want over the way I did last, I thought that this second interview was a. Ah, very interesting one and shows the way in which therapy begins to get underway. Um, this particular individual came uh, in, in the first interview, uh, with the problem all sort of neatly labeled and packaged and going ahead quickly, intellectually now quite on his own initiative, he's come to realize that uh. Somehow that isn't the answer. And uh, he sinks back into the muddlement and confusion that is himself. And then as he begins to explore in these confused uh, feelings, which are certainly far from clear to him, uh, he finds that they make a certain amount of sense. And uh. Uh. It seems to me that he has begun on um. The. That in this interview you could really say he has begun on the process of self exploration where uh. In the first interview I feel he was looking at himself more from outside and making a um. Uh. Neat diagnosis of what his patterns were and so forth, uh, I felt that there was some significance in the um. Fairly long pause during the latter part of the interview. I think I've come to feel that when the client uh, is able to pause, it has um. Some real meaning that no longer does he feel this necessity of pouring out data for me. He's beginning to turn inward and to begin to uh, explore. What do I feel? What are these sensations I have? What are the elements of the confusion I'm in? And I um, believe that uh. That was a part of what was going on during that pause, I feel that the relationship is good is beginning to take on a little more depth of understanding than was evident in the first interview. Uh, I think one can begin to see here the real start of the therapeutic process, particularly as he asks himself, uh, what is there in me that in any way wants to move forward. I thought that was, uh, quite an interesting bit in the interview where, though I felt I had rather adequately reflected what he had expressed. Um, he was quite horrified at the thought that there was nothing in him that wanted to move forward. And he wanted to very quickly, uh, correct my misunderstanding of his feeling. Uh, on net score. I might just add that for me as therapist, and this may seem curious to many people, I really no longer feel any urge to try to figure out now where is this going? What will come next? Uh, what issues will he explore? Now, to me, that seems somewhat irrelevant and quite unnecessary for me to be concerned about that I can rest comfortably in the fact that a process has been started in him which will lead him somewhere. And that, uh, I can best facilitate that process of search not by my intellectual astuteness in guessing beforehand where it may go, but by being a sensitive and understanding companion of him in every step of the search that he may wish to make and in any direction that he may wish to make it. So that I genuinely feel that I will enter the next interview in the most helpful fashion if I have not burdened my thoughts and attitudes with the question of now, where does this lead? Uh, he knows inwardly at some level where it is leading. And, uh, I can rest quite assured that he will slowly follow that inward need to explore the, um, areas that cause tension. One interesting example of this inner tendency to follow, uh, where one's feelings lead is given in the way in which he, uh, described the fact that he realizes that though homosexuality might well be said to be his problem from society's point of view or from a long range point of view, that's not the problem that his feelings are really concerned with. His feelings at this moment are concerned with his confusion. And so, uh, we already see the beginning of this inner direction that I'm sure he doesn't know about consciously, but that he just follows unconsciously. And realizing it doesn't do much good to talk about something that's intellectually a problem. I feel better in talking about the things that really concern me. And I think that, uh, type of feeling on his part will no doubt be followed again and again as therapy progresses.",

So if I did come to a conclusion that they're all the same problem. And that it all follows a pattern or something. But I still don't know what to do about it. There just doesn't seem to be any inner drive, um. Uh, all along the line to make, uh. Myself turn over and leave or something. I know I should, but there doesn't seem to be any inner compulsion. Maybe it's part of my philosophy. I don't feel that you can work for very long in purely artificial drive. That's people that take jobs that they don't really want to spend their life doing. I don't see how they can ever make it successful. Because there has to be something within yourself that is going to keep pushing you along all the time.",

When they find it, they all focus on one spot. And you see all these things focusing on one spot. Well, if I could do that, focus them, I think I could do whatever I wanted to. But I don't keep going off in all directions. I spend tons of energy acting. Or at least I think it must take some energy acting apart. Um, instead of, well, energy that I could use better somewhere else or something. And then, uh, getting an idea. I get lots of nice ideas. But I mentally, uh, too lazy to follow them up. And that's another. Just another searchlight that is a little bit off the beam at this time.",

And so I got off and went sort of plowing around the loop, looking at all theaters. And, um, was sort of tempted by one. And I had just enough money to get to the movie and back to Anston on the subway. But, uh, I thought I'd walk around the block and let the temptation cool off a little bit more. And, uh. I was just sort of lost. I didn't quite know what I wanted to do. And, um. I knew, of course, that I should go back and be practicing. I should be practicing four or 5 hours a day. Of course I'm not. But, um. No, I gave up the movie idea and I went and had a coke at a drugstore and went back on the subway and practiced for an hour and a half. George. I was so completely lost. I didn't really know what I wanted to do, why, but at least I managed to overcome that. I felt real fun.",

I want to relax after more or less pushing myself. Except I don't really push myself like the other kids do it in a sense of a way. They push themselves fairly steadily and get things done. Uh, and I push myself tremendously hard. For about three or 4 hours at a time. Just in order to get in one thing. And it's a living from day to day proposition. The assignment falls due on one day. And I probably get up early in the morning and work at it until it's due or something. This gets back to what I said at the beginning. Yet I know all along that's making it much more difficult.",

In the first interview I feel he was looking at himself more from outside and making a um. Uh. Neat diagnosis of what his patterns were and so forth, uh, I felt that there was some significance in the um. Fairly long pause during the latter part of the interview. I think I've come to feel that when the client uh, is able to pause, it has um. Some real meaning that no longer does he feel this necessity of pouring out data for me. He's beginning to turn inward and to begin to uh, explore. What do I feel? What are these sensations I have? What are the elements of the confusion I'm in? And I um, believe that uh. That was a part of what was going on during that pause, I feel that the relationship is good is beginning to take on a little more depth of understanding than was evident in the first interview. Uh, I think one can begin to see here the real start of the therapeutic process, particularly as he asks himself, uh, what is there in me that in any way wants to move forward. I thought that was, uh, quite an interesting bit in the interview where, though I felt I had rather adequately reflected what he had expressed. Um, he was quite horrified at the thought that there was nothing in him that wanted to move forward. And he wanted to very quickly, uh, correct my misunderstanding of his feeling. Uh, on net score. I might just add that for me as therapist, and this may seem curious to many people, I really no longer feel any urge to try to figure out now where is this going? What will come next? Uh, what issues will he explore? Now, to me, that seems somewhat irrelevant and quite unnecessary for me to be concerned about that I can rest comfortably in the fact that a process has been started in him which will lead him somewhere. And that, uh, I can best facilitate that process of search not by my intellectual astuteness in guessing beforehand where it may go, but by being a sensitive and understanding companion of him in every step of the search that he may wish to make and in any direction that he may wish to make it. So that I genuinely feel that I will enter the next interview in the most helpful fashion if I have not burdened my thoughts and attitudes with the question of now, where does this lead? Uh, he knows inwardly at some level where it is leading. And, uh, I can rest quite assured that he will slowly follow that inward need to explore the, um, areas that cause tension. One interesting example of this inner tendency to follow, uh, where one's feelings lead is given in the way in which he, uh, described the fact that he realizes that though homosexuality might well be said to be his problem from society's point of view or from a long range point of view, that's not the problem that his feelings are really concerned with. His feelings at this moment are concerned with his confusion. And so, uh, we already see the beginning of this inner direction that I'm sure he doesn't know about consciously, but that he just follows unconsciously. And realizing it doesn't do much good to talk about something that's intellectually a problem. I feel better in talking about the things that really concern me. And I think that, uh, type of feeling on his part will no doubt be followed again and again as therapy progresses.",

  "summary": "- Speaker A tells the interviewee that he puts everything off until the last minute and pays the price for it. He doesn't learn from it and keeps doing it. The interviewer thinks it might be some sort of self punishment or something.\n- The two things that bother the most are the things that keep cropping up day by day. One is that there is no inner drive to do something and the other is that it is hard to make decisions.\n- Speaker A started reading more critically this week. This was encouraging because it was a step away from mental laziness.\n- Neil and the others are talking about their dissatisfaction with the progress of their writing. Neil thinks it is hard to start from scratch when he is in the middle of a maelstrom.\n- Speaker A and Speaker B talk about movies. Speaker B thinks movies have a compelling pull and Speaker A always thinks of things in the long run. Speaker C thinks movies are a real addiction.\n- Speaker A tells the group about the thought process of going round and round in a circle in his senior year in high school. He doesn't like it because he doesn't get any clear perspective.\n- Speaker C wants to know what it is in me that is working against him.\n- Speaker C thinks the demands on people to meet deadlines and so on are kind of fortunate because it saves them from facing the complete frustration they would feel if nobody forced them to do anything.\n- Speaker C thinks the second interview was a very interesting one and shows the way in which therapy begins to get underway. The client has begun on the process of self exploration and he will slowly follow that inward need to explore the areas that cause tension.",
