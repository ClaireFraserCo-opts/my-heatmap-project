Carl R. Rogers, as the originator of client centered therapy and a vigorous champion of a humane, person oriented tradition in american psychology, has been without doubt the most influential leader in the counseling profession. Through his many writings, which include on becoming a person, client centered therapy, and on counseling and psychotherapy, and through national leadership, which has included the presidency of the American Psychological Association, Dr. Rogers has served as a model of scientific integrity, uh, personal openness, genuineness and warmth to two generations of professionals. From his early interest in individual therapy, his interests have broadened to include a deep and abiding concern with the process of education, best expressed in his book freedom to learn the potential of the encounter group movement, reflected in his book Carl Rogers on encounter groups and marriage and the relationships between men and women, the subject of his book on becoming partners. Uh, in this film, Dr. Rogers interviews a couple about what the experience of partnership has been like for them. In a commentary after the interview, he indicates what he observed and learned from participating in the session. Is that right, John? Yeah. Good to meet you. Um. I think what I'd hoped for is that, uh. I'd like to know what in your marriage has been, what have been some of the most meaningful or significant aspects or elements. They might be, um, good, they might be bad. Um. Uh, you might both have quite the same point of view. You might have very different points of view, but it's that kind of thing that I'd like to, uh, see, uh, if I can get from you. Part of the reason is that I think that in spite of all the books about marriage and all that kind of stuff, there is very little that gives, uh, a picture of what marriage is like or partnerships are like, whether marriage or not, uh, as seen through the eyes of the couple. Um, and that's what I really am interested in, how some, uh, of these different things seem to you individually. And, uh. So, uh, I guess it's enough an introduction. I'll just return to my original question. Uh, what are some of the things that do you seem like the important things that you like or don't like about your partnership, either now or in the past, or if you want to guess about the future? I feel. One thing I really like is that, um. I feel that we grow together. It kind of sounds like a cliche. That's what you always hear about it's supposed to be, but I really feel like that if I get interested in something, I can get John interested in it, and I feel that I'm more compatible or he's more compatible with me. Now, than we were at the beginning. He shares a lot more interests than we did at first. Just because he's interested in what I'm interested in. And I really like that feeling. Are you interested in more of what he's interested in? Well, I try to be. I am too. But it's that aspect of growing in the things you share is that m. And it doesn't have to start out shared either. It can start out as an independent adventure. And the other person begins, you can. Have an interest in something, and gradually, perhaps he joins you in that. I think I feel the same, um, dynamic that Nancy does. That we, in a lot of areas are growing in the same direction and finding new interests together. On the other hand, one of the things that's been most meaningful to me, I think, is in finding someone who I feel is a very compatible partner. That we share a lot of values, that we always did share a lot of values and see things very similarly. And I think there's a lot in that to me. I'd gone out with a lot of other, um, girls before I met Nancy. And I never felt that there was someone quite as special to me as Nancy turned out to be. And that that is, in considerable part, at least, a matter of really sharing some of the same values. I think so. I think it does amount to that. Um, you look young. Has this been going on for a long time or not? Well, we've been married for six months, and we lived together for a year and a half. Before that, about two and a half years we've known each other. In two years we've been living together. Um, what are some of the, uh, is it a smooth kind of marriage? Does it go up and down or smooth kind of partnership? Because I really would like to include the whole period. I feel like it's smooth fairly self. Every day to day I feel happy, which is one of the things I like about the marriage. It's not that I can sit and intellectually think, um, this is a good person for me, but just I get up and I feel happy about things occasionally. I think we might have a few days in a row where we really get on each other's nerves. But it's not a big problem that suddenly cropped up. But some outside thing we're worrying about that's making us more irritable. Any comments? Um, I guess I also see it as being, um, fairly smooth. I feel like, uh, right when the process of getting married, that at that time it got to be a little bit bumpier in terms of my own anxieties about, um, changing somehow the nature of our commitment. People we talked to seem to suggest that it would be different after we were married. And I guess in all honesty, when I looked at some of the types of lives that some of our married acquaintances seem to be living, I was a little bit worried that, ah, I don't know if I really want that type of. You hoped it wouldn't be like. You hoped it wouldn't be like that. I guess I did. I anticipated that it might be and I wasn't sure. And so I think right at the time of getting married, I was a little bit worried, um, about what it might turn out to be like. But things um, have gotten very smooth again. But at the time of the marriage, that really gave you more concern than the partnership that had preceded it? Yeah, it did. I think before I could really feel that, um, every day we were kind of reducing each other and that, um. You didn't have to be together. You were together. Right. M that somehow there was a freedom that in marriage might not exist. How about you? Did marriage make any difference as far as you were concerned? No, I really don't feel any difference. At know, John every once in a while would say something, um, know, I do see a difference and it wasn't like this, know, not that it got especially worse, but I don't know if it was that I felt married before I was or that I still feel like I'm living together instead of married, but it all seems very much the same. But at least for you that was no great change in the relationship. It was a good thing for me because, um, while we were living together, I was worried about my parents finding out about. So this took a lot of tension off and that we didn't have to hide this, at least be open about it. Right. I really enjoyed that. So in that way it's been a plus. Mhm. I think so. M you spoke at the first as though you're able to do what you want to do, what you're interested in, and uh, gather Don is able to do the same. Can you say any more about that? Well, I think this was a very conscious decision that we said, listen, we both have to be free to do what other things, including dating other people and things like that. Because one person can't be everything to another person. I have some interest know, even though John's interested in hearing something about it, he can't be as fully enthusiastic about it as I am. So if I want to go out and do it by myself or find a friend to do it with, then I expect to be fine. And it is fine. And I think that's really a good thing. We really like it, especially when we see how this is often what has fouled up other couples, that they have all these great expectations of the other person and they can't do things outside of the line. But you feel quite free to do what, you feel free to relate to John, but also you feel quite free to do other things that he might not be in on dating and so on. Mhm. I feel that it's really necessary too. You've got to bring in other things from outside the relationship. Two independent people relating, not two people sewed together in a marriage. M anything to say on that? Yeah, I was just thinking that really, ah, resonates with me in that, um, I think the greatest thing which has made me feel relaxed about the marriage is I feel in Nancy, I have complete freedom to be myself, do whatever I want to do. And at times some of the things even scare me, the things that I might think of or feel like doing. And Nancy is very accepting about that. And with her it's all right to do it. And I know that really makes me feel good because I can feel I can really be myself and do what I want to do at the time. M and I, um, think if it weren't for that, I would still feel somewhat threatened with the idea of being married. That it would be a constraining force instead of one in which I'm not constrained at all anymore than I used to be. You don't want to be in a box and you don't find yourself in a box. Right. And I think I realize at times too, that I don't reciprocate with Nancy as much. At times I place more of the role expectation upon her than she does upon me. Or I can't be completely as free with her as she is with me. And I know how good it feels to me. Um, you mean you can't quite give her the full amount of freedom that she gives you? Is that what you're saying? Yeah, mhm. Uh, incidentally, if I ask questions that you don't care to answer, don't hesitate to say, no, I'd rather not. I'd rather have you be really free in what you say than pretend and answer. But you said, uh, the, ah, freedom that she gives you sometimes leads you into things that even scare you. Would you be willing to, uh, give an example or say what you mean by that? Yeah, I guess a good example is, um, right after we first got married, I'd still really want to go out with some other girls sometimes it might be more often than I thought was appropriate, or somehow didn't feel exactly right being married and yet going out in very close to a dating situation. And I think I feel the role expectation still more than Nancy does, that, um, when you're married, society and most of your friends see you in the traditional role of being married. You're supposed to be a husband, right? You're supposed to be a husband. A lot of things go with that. Um, there's a lot of things in society which really uh, strengthen the idea that there are certain things which are very inappropriate and everyone, most people live up to them. And so I think when I considered some of the things that we seem to do, or that I seem to be suggesting that I want to do at least, or I felt that I wanted to do, um, I'd still kind of hesitate. And you know, I wonder if I dare say this to Nancy, or I wonder if it really is right if I should be doing it. Mhm. But Nancy always was able to um, say, jesus, all right. It doesn't bother me. She's supportive of you. Even when you, when I'm not sure, you're not sure yourself. M uh, I'd be interested to know. I don't think that's a common attitude. How do you feel you came to the point of view of feeling? Yeah, go ahead, you're free to do what you want to do. Well, I really don't know too much how it started. It just seemed to, the conscious idea, it was very easy flowing. He didn't suddenly make a decision one night. This is how it had to be. The emotional process is a lot more of a lagging thing where um, I remember one particular period of about two months. It's the springtime. John's going wild. This was uh, at a time before we married, but living together, just going wild, taking girls out every day. And it was really getting to me then. And I would feel very upset, but know, try and be objective about it and of course come out being very crooked. And that has just kind of gradually worn off because every time he goes out with a girl and comes back and even if he's made love with her or whatever, he comes back to me and I'm an important one. So in spite of those dates and affairs and so on, still it sort. Of reaffirms you, right, because each time he comes back to me, so it's like he said, he's not really shopping, but I still get to see all these girls, and you're still the one I choose, so it's a constant. Makes it more of a real choice. But he really does choose you, so. In ways, I really like him. And do you feel, um, as great a freedom as he does? I gather there was some little difference. And then I wondered, do you feel as much freedom to go out to fellas as he does? Well, he does not usually, but it's not usually a practical problem because I'm not a very social type, and I don't usually prefer to go out with people. Anyone. On occasion, when it does come up, I think I have more of a problem. Not that he'd forbid me to go out, but he often, um, says, well, isn't it kind of dangerous? You don't know this guy. He doesn't know the girls. He goes out. Of course, it probably is more dangerous on my part, but it does feel kind of constraining. Listen, don't go out with him. You don't know what he's like, so it ends up as kind of constrainment. But he's not doing it maliciously because he wants to constrain him, just because he's honestly concerned. Not a real concern. And, uh, is there any usual answer to what happens then? Um, do you tend to say, well, I can take care of myself, or do you tend to say, well, if. You'Re concerned, no, I don't go ahead if you're concerned. I never have. Have. I don't think so. I think that's why I feel like. I can strain you more m than you do me. It's not that I usually wanted to go out that much. If there's somebody that I really wanted to go out with, maybe I would first try and convince him, and it would probably come down to a point, well, if that's the way he feels, then go ahead and do it. And I'd go ahead and do it, even knowing that he had some reservations about it. Um, you said that, uh, before you're made, when he was going through this sort of spree of dating a lot of other girls, it really got to you. What were your feelings then? You said you were upset, but can you say a little more about that? I guess I just felt jealous in that, um, sometimes he was out while I was at class, so I couldn't be with him anyhow. But often he'd be out 3 hours when I was only busy 1 hour. And you kind of get the feeling, well, why didn't he wait for me? And it would have gone out 2 hours anyhow. And it's just you kind of wish it was you that was chosen instead of the other person. But objectively, I'd think, well, of course it's more exciting about a, uh, different girl. And I'm aware of the fact that John really loves meeting new people. He loves to talk to them and find out all about them. So it's really an exciting process for him. So I try and control myself of that. But you still have the emotional feeling of, jeez, I wish he'd waited for me. Sounds that your mind says what he's doing is perfectly okay. It's really okay. Only not all of you. It's a little harder in actual process. Part of it talks to the other part. One says, hurts. Why didn't they think that much of me? Another part says, sure, it's okay. Yeah, we ended up in a lot of crazy arguments and that kind of thing, where your emotional and objective rational sides are at war. It often turns out really cockeyed because I'd make up some kind of a logical argument or something really weird where. Your mind is trying to justify what you really feel. Mhm. And what comes out is kind of a nutty argument. So that was kind of an unhappy period. Um, can you say anything about any of the. What difficulties have you had in your period of partnership? What would you think were some of the, uh, most stressful points? Obviously this was one when he was going out with a lot of girls. Are there others? I think for me, the most difficult thing has been a reflection of what we're just talking about in that, um, I really like going out with other people. I tend to like groups of three or four, five, six people, instead of just Nancy and I being by ourselves maybe all day. And Nancy isn't as inclined in that direction as I am. And so I've had to kind of adjust the idea that really I shouldn't put my thing on Nancy and that we should always have company over every night. And so I think, um, in some ways I've just compromised and modified my own desires. M on the other hand, if there was any one major thing or area where at times I wish things were a little bit different, it would probably be that. If you could make her over a little, you'd make her into someone a little bit more socially inclined. I don't even know if I'd do know. In its own way, it's nice having someone who, if Nancy was just like me, um, we'd probably get sick of having people over. Actually, we might just be two people who would overdo a good thing. So I don't even know if I'd make her over. But at times, I think there's little moments of stress or disappointment that I might wish, jeez, I'd like to really do something with someone this weekend or have someone over today. And Nancy's not really too turned on by it, so if we have someone over Nancy, we'll be very accepting of it, but it'll be kind of just response to my desires at the time. And for you, what are some of the, uh, aside from the one you've mentioned, what are some of the, um, dissatisfactions that you sometimes feel? I think, especially at first, and this, too, has been working itself away, but I still feel it at times, is that our values kind of differed, um, especially when we first met, that John thought, he's very hedonistic, and he always thought really nice not to work and be rich and just be able to do what you wanted all day. And I still have more of a kind of puritan work ethic. Not where I really want to work hard. I'm all with it. You should be able to do whatever you want to do. But if I were given the choice of doing whatever I want to do, I would feel like I really wanted to work at something. Maybe not a 40 hours a day job, but work at something I liked. And I think I would structure my time a lot more in that. And that bothered me more at, you know, I'm gradually coming to see his ways, but I still feel like there's a lot more that I want to do, and that maybe if John didn't really try, he would just turn into kind of a lazy bum. Not that I want him to work, he doesn't want to, but I want him to be doing something while he isn't working, besides just flying around. And I think maybe he could do that. He probably won't, but possibly that could happen and sometimes worries me. That's interesting, because somehow, just from seeing you, I wouldn't get almost a reverse impression. Ah. What do you have to say about that? Think there's any likelihood of you becoming a lazy bum? Um, no, I don't think so. At times. I think overall, Nancy, at this point in time, at least, can really get into more things with more enthusiasm than I can. But I think Nancy, Nancy upon thought, would realize that there are some things I really get interested in. M but I tend to be focused on one thing at a time. And ah, when I get into it, I usually zip into it with a lot of enthusiasm. You see it more as your rhythms being different. I mean, if you, uh, get focused on something, bingo, that's it. Yeah. But then there might be a period when you're not focused very much at the moment. Yeah, I think I tend to come and go a lot like that. M. Yeah, I should know that. And I do rationally when I sit down, think about, because I know there's a lot of things, you always come up with new ideas and let's do this and let's do that. But it's just sometimes when I hear him tell people to say, well, what do you want to do? And everybody else answers, well, I have all these, I want to do this and that. And he's, oh, nothing. I just want to be rich and have fun and all this. And it kind of makes my heart skip a beat. But then I think about it, do you know what I mean? Again, it's key through your mind says, okay, that's what he likes, but, mhm. Your heart sort of. Yeah. Ah, uh, you say you share some things. Are you also fairly supportive toward each. Other in what you do? I myself feel very strongly that we are, um, in my own perception, without Nancy, I wouldn't be the same person I am today. I find that Nancy is just an integral part of a lot of the things that I do now and that I just somehow wouldn't really be doing if I didn't have her there somehow. Not even an invert encouragement, but it's just her, um, implicit support of my ideas, even if she isn't even interested in them. Like business ideas or something I might think of just really gives me a lot of encouragement to go ahead and try it and do it. And I really like that about our relationship. Mhm. Feel a certain backing, really, even though, um, there may not be a tremendous amount of interest. Yeah, I feel like sometimes I'm really dragging my feet. Especially on your business ventures. He often comes up with the way to make a quick million. And I often feel like, um, I'm saying to him, no, it's not going to work. And putting out a lot of pessimism, but probably on the whole at least I still say, well, if that's really what you want to do, go ahead and I'll come along unwillingly. You're sort of a balance feeling effect. Do you feel support from him and what you're doing? I think usually, um, sometimes I feel like he could show a little more enthusiasm. But that's probably how you feel when I show pessimism about your business senses. Um, and I don't think it's something that ever starts a fight or anything, but sometimes I just feel a little bit hurt, know, Bryce said something like, oh, listen, I'm going to go to Africa and study zebras or something and doesn't say, wow, that's a really great idea, something like that. It's really one of those problems that isn't a very practical one. It doesn't come up that often. I don't usually feel heard about it. Hypothetical, uh, sounds as though your differences are not very great. When you do have differences, how would you describe the way you fight or work through them or whatever does happen in your case? I feel we do it very logically. At least I try and be very logical and rational on my part, and John does too. I think I get more outwardly emotional. I cry very easily and, um, John M. Tends to stay very cool. I'm not sure I quite get that you're very logical, but in such situations you cry very easily. Yeah. I'm being logical through my tears, though. In terms of. You're proud of the logic rather than of the tears. Yeah, I think I am. I'd like to think of myself as, ah, a cooler person. And usually I think I am not very emotional. And I pride myself on that. Maybe because I come from kind of a scientific, engineering type family. It's all very rational. For you. Being rational is something you really value a good deal. And your tears. Yeah. It's not that I'm ashamed that I'm around John or anything, or m embarrassed by them, but it makes it very hard to talk practically. It's a problem. And he never cries, so why should I be the one crying? Do you share that picture of her? And what's your reaction to how you work things out? Um, well, Nancy does cry. I don't think that it's deeply emotional for her, but she cries easily in some ways. On one hand, I guess I'm not sure that I like hearing the rational thing way over. The emotional is the way it kind of sounds. On the other hand, I think we've both, um, been involved in situations where we weren't sure really how we felt. And the whole thing was kind of threatening. The motions are kind of mixed, and instead of stopping, we kind of let rationality lead and said, well, we can probably try it and handle it. And if it doesn't work out, all right, we'll just say, well, it didn't work out and we won't do it again. And I think overall it's been an asset more than a hindrance, um, to be willing to kind of venture forward even when your emotions are, um, a little bit mixed up or maybe even say something a little bit different from what you're thinking. So both of you really put rationality above, a little above what you're actually feeling. Is that getting that picture right? Settling of disputes and so on? Mhm. I think that would be the important thing, is how you rationally think of it. Even if I feel jealous, I say, well, we both know that it's right that you do this. Does that really get rid of the jealousy? I think it helps. I really do. Um, maybe it's partly that I'm proud of, um, being able to control my emotions somewhat so that I can work at it anyhow. What were you going to say then? I was going to say I'm not as good at, ah, letting rationality lead me all the time. And I think that's sometimes where I don't give her as much freedom as she gives me. So I think on one hand I really feel that it's somehow coming in my direction. It's a real good attribute that Nancy is rational and lets rationality lead. But I think I'm more of, um, on a balancing post where at times I'll say, hey, I don't feel good about this, so I wish we wouldn't do it. And at other times I'll, um, let rationality lead, or what I see as rationality, or I'll be willing to say, all right, we'll push a scale into this direction. I'll take the step, even though I don't really feel that way. That's such a do sometimes. Yeah. Do you think that, uh, um, you've never really been in a serious crisis, I gathered between you? Or would you say you have? I don't think, um, there's ever been too serious a problem, but I feel sometimes I can think of one occasion in particular when we went on a trip with some friends and I was just annoying John all know, not purposely, but just kind of feeling crabby on my part. And at the end of the day he came know I knew he was mad at me. He started acting kind of cool. And then we finally got a chance to talk about it. He said, listen, I want to go away for a week and not see you. And I just really felt terrible. And that really served me. I think that's the biggest. At least that's the worst emotional thing I ever felt. I don't know if that was ever the most dramatic fight, but it was the worst I ever felt. Because it's kind of like having the rug pulled out. And it sounds as though, in that case, both your crabiness during the day and your feeling of oh, wow, this is terrible. That evening. Neither of those sound, um, particularly logical. No, I suppose not. Um, there are more emotional reactions. I found it very interesting to talk to Nancy and John. I was sorry that our time ran out. Without my m. Having a chance to really bid them farewell. Uh, they certainly are a very modern young couple in many ways, I think. Here's a, um. Partnership that's lasted two and a half years. But they've only been married for six months of that period. Uh, the marriage was upsetting only to John. He found it bumpier, as he said, to meet, um. The role expectations of being a husband. And society expected things of him as a husband that they, uh, hadn't expected before. I was interested in his phrase that up to the time of their marriage. He felt they were choosing each other every day. Um, and after marriage the choice was made, uh, which evidently bothered him some. One thing that certainly stood out was the fact that Nancy gives John an astonishing amount of, uh. Freedom. To have his own dates, to have affairs. Um, and yet, in some ways she feels confirmed. Because after each of his, uh uh, dates and so on. He returns to her. Making her feel that after all the alternatives. He still chooses her as the person, uh. That he wants to be with. Um, however, we can't overlook the fact that she is hurt and jealous at times like that. Uh, even though her reason and her logic tell her that, uh. She shouldn't be. That's perfectly all right. Um, John, who runs a little bit more on his feelings. Can't give her as much freedom as she gives him. Um, logic doesn't rule in his world. And, um, he constrains her in many more ways than, uh, she constrains him. I think that, uh. The degree of freedom that he has. Is especially indicated by the fact that, uh. He's sometimes scared of all the freedom that, uh, he gives her. He wonders, uh, is this really okay to do, uh, things like this. Uh, or should I abide by a more conventional role? But then she tells him, that's all right. Um, they seem to be a compatible young couple. Um, sharing an increasing number of interests. And really appreciating each other. Uh, he likes her as kind of a balance wheel. And, uh, to some extent, I think that's reciprocated. Uh, it's kind of a surprising reversal that in this case, Nancy is the one who has the work ethic. She believes you should really be putting in your time usefully. And that, uh, he's the hedonist. And as she says, maybe, uh, he could even become a lazy bum, uh, which, uh, troubles her somewhat. But I'd like to get to the main concern that I felt about this young, uh, couple. Uh, and that is Nancy's tendency to try to control and deny her feelings. Uh, here's a young woman who weeps easily. I think you could tell from her appearance she's an emotional person. Uh, she gets hurt and jealous. She, uh, feels it was the worst day in her life. When John said after she'd been kind of irritable all day, that, uh, he guessed he would leave her for a week. Um, and yet she tries to hide all this by putting reason, uh, and logic ahead of her feelings, uh, and emotions. She's a strong one for rational thinking. Logic, um, is her way for solving, uh, problems. And she feels that all their difficulties can be, uh, resolved if they can be logical and reasonable about it. Um, it even applies to the freedom that she gives to John. She thinks in her mind that, um, that's the way it should be. She should give him complete freedom. So she does, uh, and then she tries to suppress the hurt that she feels when he, for example, takes a girl out for 3 hours, when really, uh, he could have taken her out. For two of those 3 hours. She wasn't busy all that time. Uh, in my judgment, and I'm sure my bias showed through in the interview, someday these, um, denied feelings in her are going to cause difficulty in this partnership. Uh. Uh, they'll catch up with her. I don't know exactly how they'll come out. I don't have any idea about that. But when they do catch up with her, that's not going to be a very happy time for her, nor for him, nor for their relationship. Um, there's one. Concluding statement that I would make. They said that they supported each other in their occupations and seemed to feel they were really supportive. Um, after the close of the interview, I learned what their occupations were, and, um, I have their permission to tell you what they do. Um, John, in spite of his perhaps, uh, rather lazy inclination, teaches, uh, business and is involved in business affairs. Um, she's a part time student, which doesn't seem surprising, and a girl who comes from a scientific and engineering family. But she does her share to support the family and to pay for her education by putting in part time as a topless go go dancer. Uh, I don't know whether that gives you a jolt, but it gave me somewhat of a jolt to, uh, learn that. And the interesting thing is that that's with her husband's approval, because it's a far more lucrative, uh, occupation than, uh, any other job she could get. So perhaps that, uh, indicates more than anything that I could say that you can't stereotype people. Uh, they are unique beyond our wildest imagination. And, uh, each couple finds its own way of endeavoring to cope with life, sometimes successfully, sometimes not so successfully. And as I say, I think that this couple, though they, uh, have many things going for them, also have this one element that may cause them real difficulty in the future. Unless she's able to recognize that, uh, her feelings are just as important as her ideas, and that rationality is not the answer to all problems. And that she's got to enter into the relationship as a whole person, accepting both her feelings and her reasoning.", "words": [{"text": "Mhm.", "start": 21000, "end": 24260, "confidence":

I was sorry that our time ran out. Without my m. Having a chance to really bid them farewell. Uh, they certainly are a very modern young couple in many ways, I think. Here's a, um. Partnership that's lasted two and a half years. But they've only been married for six months of that period. Uh, the marriage was upsetting only to John. He found it bumpier, as he said, to meet, um. The role expectations of being a husband. And society expected things of him as a husband that they, uh, hadn't expected before. I was interested in his phrase that up to the time of their marriage. He felt they were choosing each other every day. Um, and after marriage the choice was made, uh, which evidently bothered him some. One thing that certainly stood out was the fact that Nancy gives John an astonishing amount of, uh. Freedom. To have his own dates, to have affairs. Um, and yet, in some ways she feels confirmed. Because after each of his, uh uh, dates and so on. He returns to her. Making her feel that after all the alternatives. He still chooses her as the person, uh. That he wants to be with. Um, however, we can't overlook the fact that she is hurt and jealous at times like that. Uh, even though her reason and her logic tell her that, uh. She shouldn't be. That's perfectly all right. Um, John, who runs a little bit more on his feelings. Can't give her as much freedom as she gives him. Um, logic doesn't rule in his world. And, um, he constrains her in many more ways than, uh, she constrains him. I think that, uh. The degree of freedom that he has. Is especially indicated by the fact that, uh. He's sometimes scared of all the freedom that, uh, he gives her. He wonders, uh, is this really okay to do, uh, things like this. Uh, or should I abide by a more conventional role? But then she tells him, that's all right. Um, they seem to be a compatible young couple. Um, sharing an increasing number of interests. And really appreciating each other. Uh, he likes her as kind of a balance wheel. And, uh, to some extent, I think that's reciprocated. Uh, it's kind of a surprising reversal that in this case, Nancy is the one who has the work ethic. She believes you should really be putting in your time usefully. And that, uh, he's the hedonist. And as she says, maybe, uh, he could even become a lazy bum, uh, which, uh, troubles her somewhat. But I'd like to get to the main concern that I felt about this young, uh, couple. Uh, and that is Nancy's tendency to try to control and deny her feelings. Uh, here's a young woman who weeps easily. I think you could tell from her appearance she's an emotional person. Uh, she gets hurt and jealous. She, uh, feels it was the worst day in her life. When John said after she'd been kind of irritable all day, that, uh, he guessed he would leave her for a week. Um, and yet she tries to hide all this by putting reason, uh, and logic ahead of her feelings, uh, and emotions. She's a strong one for rational thinking. Logic, um, is her way for solving, uh, problems. And she feels that all their difficulties can be, uh, resolved if they can be logical and reasonable about it. Um, it even applies to the freedom that she gives to John. She thinks in her mind that, um, that's the way it should be. She should give him complete freedom. So she does, uh, and then she tries to suppress the hurt that she feels when he, for example, takes a girl out for 3 hours, when really, uh, he could have taken her out.", "start": 2083860, "end":

John asks Carl R. Rogers what his marriage has been, what have been some of the most meaningful or significant aspects or elements. He wants to know what marriage is like or partnerships are like, as seen through the eyes of the couple.\n- Speaker D tells the interviewer that he likes that they grow together and find new interests together in their marriage. He feels that they share a lot of values and see things very similarly.\n- Speaker D and Speaker A agree that they both have to be free to do other things, including dating other people and things like that. Speaker B agrees that it is necessary to bring in other things from outside the relationship.\n- John was going wild before they married, dating a lot of other girls. The emotional process is a lagging thing.\n- Speaker A tells the interviewer that the most difficult thing in his period of partnership is that he likes going out with other people and Nancy isn't as inclined in that direction as he is.\n- John and Nancy have different values. John is hedonistic, while Nancy still has a kind of puritan work ethic. It worries that John would turn into a lazy bum.\n- John and Nancy have differences in how they fight or work through their differences. John is more emotional and Nancy is more logical. They both put rationality above, a little above what they're actually feeling.\n- Speaker D tells Speaker A that Speaker A has never been in a serious crisis but Speaker A feels the worst emotional thing Speaker A ever felt when annoying John. Speaker A thinks there are more emotional reactions.\n- Speaker E talks to Nancy and John about their marriage. Nancy gives John an astonishing amount of freedom. John is sometimes scared of all the freedom that he gives her. Nancy is the one who has the work ethic.\n- The main concern is Nancy's tendency to try to control and deny her feelings. She tries to hide all this by putting reason, and logic ahead of her feelings, and emotions. The feelings will catch up with her in the future.", "auto_highlights_result": {"status": "success", "results": [{"count": 3, "rank": 0.08, "text": "other things", "timestamps": [{"start": 592802, "end": 593368}, {"start": 642742, "end": 643184}, {"start": 653478, "end": 653952}]}, {"count": 1, "rank": 0.08, "text": "more things", "timestamps": [{"start": 1458632, "end": 1459154}]}, {"count": 1, "rank": 0.07, "text": "many things", "timestamps": [{"start": 2574982, "end": 2575472}]}, {"count": 1, "rank": 0.07, "text": "other times", "timestamps": [{"start": 1969728, "end": 1970458}]}, {"count": 1, "rank": 0.06, "text": "certain things", "timestamps": [{"start": 824558, "end": 824856}]}, {"count": 2, "rank": 0.06, "text": "other people", "timestamps": [{"start": 594348, "end": 594880}, {"start": 1237968, "end": 1238634}]}, {"count": 1, "rank": 0.06, "text": "many more ways", "timestamps": [{"start": 2229718, "end": 2230400}]}, {"count": 2, "rank": 0.06, "text": "part time", "timestamps": [{"start": 2500058, "end": 2500600}, {"start": 2516482, "end": 2517100}]}, {"count": 1, "rank": 0.06, "text": "other couples", "timestamps": [{"start": 628638, "end": 629284}]}, {"count": 2, "rank": 0.05, "text": "other girls", "timestamps": [{"start": 786418, "end": 787096}, {"start": 1083298, "end": 1083976}]}, {"count": 1, "rank": 0.05, "text": "more concern", "timestamps": [{"start": 484242, "end": 484952}]}, {"count": 2, "rank": 0.05, "text": "more enthusiasm", "timestamps": [{"start": 1459368, "end": 1460126}, {"start": 1657958, "end": 1658924}]}, {"count": 24, "rank": 0.05, "text": "Nancy", "timestamps": [{"start": 289628, "end": 290034}, {"start": 323688, "end": 324062}, {"start": 327608, "end": 327886}, {"start": 682578, "end": 682952}, {"start": 695302, "end": 695884}, {"start": 731938, "end": 732264}, {"start": 803078, "end": 803372}, {"start": 840994, "end": 841352}, {"start": 847302, "end": 847740}, {"start": 1244288, "end": 1244614}, {"start": 1248228, "end": 1248714}, {"start": 1257764, "end": 1258074}, {"start": 1288832, "end": 1289126}, {"start": 1312712, "end": 1313102}, {"start": 1455246, "end": 1455970}, {"start": 1462152, "end": 1462850}, {"start": 1464550, "end": 1464974}, {"start": 1561980, "end": 1562710}, {"start": 1567948, "end": 1568630}, {"start": 1811062, "end": 1811404}, {"start": 1956508, "end": 1957026}, {"start": 2086378, "end": 2086944}, {"start": 2157614, "end": 2158132}, {"start": 2294538, "end": 2295152}]}, {"count": 3, "rank": 0.04, "text": "good thing", "timestamps": [{"start": 549302, "end": 549792}, {"start": 621038, "end": 621850}, {"start": 1296864, "end": 1297610}]}, {"count": 1, "rank": 0.04, "text": "new people", "timestamps": [{"start": 1126628, "end": 1127224}]}]}, "content_safety_labels": null, "iab_categories_result": {"status": "success", "results": [{"text": "Mhm.
