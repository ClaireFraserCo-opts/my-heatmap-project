Do you know anything about the, um, employment, these employee employment agency that you register with? I thought I wanted to work for one of them. They work strictly commission. Uh, they're always running ads. Later on, you find that they want counselors. That's one way. Or agents or, uh, something, rather. Okay. You learn later on those are paid ads. They just want you in there long enough to sell you on going to look for a job. They do always need counselors because they're always quit. Had strict commission job with no guarantee at all to it. I talked to several of them. Of course, I had, uh, in the back of my mind was another idea, too. I get in there long enough to find the best job and get out. Uh, they may have known that they're pretty bright in a way, but they definitely run. You almost could call it a racket. In a way. It's an unpalatable thing as far as I'm concerned. And, um, what you do is get as many jobs as you possibly can get your hands on, m by hook or crook. And you get as many people into you as your desk. Everybody's on his own. They have the name of the company or anything, and you try to get them paired off. So the, uh, universal rule is you get as many people walking as you can get walking. If you've got any time to line up their list of cars and people and try to get any sort of fit, that's up to you. But it's largely considered. I have since learned I know some of those people now, a, uh, waste of everybody's time to waste any time trying to fit in the job. And a person, if, uh, it says definitely no colored people or something, I'd be a little careful. Or, uh, definitely college education, where then he goes to a certain bunch. But other than that, uh, there's no effort. And you send people to places that, um, they obviously know. Um, you can tell when you get there that those people did not know this employment agency had their name at all. But they are taking applications, and they will list you. They'll take your application, and maybe they'll talk to you. But they, uh, comb the ads. They do everything, and they send you places. You're actually unwelcome. Um, and, uh, just because they know, um, through the grapevine some way that this place is taking application, and if they can get 100 of the people that they have the names of out asking for jobs, they're going to make more money. That's just the way it works. More of them are going to get jobs. Well, uh, the description of this is just to show you that they want what in their terms are, uh, what they describe as a real go getter, a real brassy, push them, shove them around person. I tried at least ten different places to get that same job, and they take one look at me and won't have anything to do with me. And those people are not dumb. They are a kind that I don't like. But it would be very wrong for me to say that they are dumb. They're not at all dumb.", "start": 2243624, "end": 2439090, "confidence": 0.9391901410934748, "word_count": 567, "frequent_wc_base": 2852, "score": 2020, "density": 3.562610229276896, "percentile": 0}, {"index": 92, "speaker": "B", "text": "And they size you up rightly when they know that you are not the brassy, sharp, uh, pushing sort of person.", "start": 2457370, "end": 2465260, "confidence": 0.9183647619047617, "word_count": 21, "frequent_wc_base": 2852, "score": 57, "density": 2.7142857142857144, "percentile": 0}, {"index": 93, "speaker": "A", "text": "That's the way maybe m those aren't accurate adjectives, but at least I'm not the sort of person that would make money, because I get 30% of the company's cut.
